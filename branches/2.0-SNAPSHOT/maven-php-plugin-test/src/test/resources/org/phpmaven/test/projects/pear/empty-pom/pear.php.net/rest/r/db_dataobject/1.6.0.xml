 <s>An SQL Builder, Object Interface to Database Tables</s>
 <d>DataObject performs 2 tasks:
  1. Builds SQL statements based on the objects vars and the builder methods.
  2. acts as a datastore for a table row.
  The core class is designed to be extended for each of your tables so that you put the
  data logic inside the data classes.
  included is a Generator to make your configuration files and your base classes.

 <n>Minor Feature Release and many bug fixes..

* DB_DataObject_Error added to enable testing for dataobject errors
* Date fixes - needs latest date package.
* Generator fails with clear message if backend doesnt support tableInfo
* added cidr, inet, macaddr for postgres
* new options to filter generation of classes
  generator_include_regex = /foo_.*/i
  generator_exclude_regex = /tmp_.*/i
* result column list is now stored for all queries (in the result object)
  so toArray() allways relates to the query.
* php version correted in package file.
* getLinks called before other database call fixed.
* Updating without changing things, no longer raises a pear error,
  it just returns 0 (eg. no rows affected)
* now Depends on 1.4 DB - escapeSimple is now used
* extra option to disable assumtions to use pear db's nextID
  dont_use_pear_sequences = true
* DebugLevel($val) if $val is not an integer - it is assumed to be a callback.
* fixed clearing of data results after last fetch (reduces memory consumption 
  when doing many queries)
* strtolower any class name tests.
* count accepts 1 or 2 arguments
  $countWhat or $whereAddonly, or $countWhat and $whereAddonly
  eg. $countWhat = &quot;distinct id&quot;
  eg. $countWhat = true (means $whereAdd = true)
* selectAdd() returns existing value, so you can modify it.
* most debugging &amp; raiseError calls are dynamic, so you can overload them.
* numbers allowed in tablenames.
* ini filename uses database_{projectname} =&gt; {projectname}.ini so
  database names are portable, and multiple projects are theoretically feasible.
* __clone is replaced with clone() for PHP5 compaitiblity.
* use PEAR::getStaticProperty(&quot;DB&quot;,&quot;options&quot;) for oracle portablity settings.
* null checked against not null spec.

And probably a few more - as it's been quite a while since the last release..</n>
