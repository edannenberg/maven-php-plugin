 <s>XML-RPC client/server library</s>
 <d>XML_RPC2 is a pear package providing XML_RPC client and server services. XML-RPC is a simple remote procedure call protocol built using HTTP as transport and XML as encoding.
As a client library, XML_RPC2 is capable of creating a proxy class which exposes the methods exported by the server. As a server library, XML_RPC2 is capable of exposing methods from a class or object instance, seamlessly exporting local methods as remotely callable procedures.</d>
