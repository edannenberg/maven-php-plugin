 <s>The add-on to HTML_QuickForm package that allows building of multipage forms</s>
 <d>The package is essentially an implementation of a PageController pattern.
Architecture:
* Controller class that examines HTTP requests and manages form values persistence across requests.
* Page class (subclass of QuickForm) representing a single page of the form.
* Business logic is contained in subclasses of Action class.
Cool features:
* Includes several default Actions that allow easy building of multipage forms.
* Includes usage examples for common usage cases (single-page form, wizard, tabbed form).

 <n>* Controller now differentiates between invalid and not-yet-validated pages. False is stored
in container's ['valid'][$pageName] field for the former, null for the latter. This is
a POTENTIAL BC BREAK, so pay attention if you wrote your own Actions.
* Back action in modal forms does not validate the page anymore (the previous behaviour was
non-intuitive, thanks to Bob Van Zant for reporting).</n>
