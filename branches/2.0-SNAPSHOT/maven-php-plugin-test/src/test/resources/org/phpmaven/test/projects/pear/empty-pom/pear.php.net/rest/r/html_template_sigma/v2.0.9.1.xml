 <s>An implementation of Integrated Templates API with template 'compilation' added</s>
 <d>HTML_Template_Sigma implements Integrated Templates API designed by Ulf Wendel.

Features:
* Nested blocks. Nesting is controlled by the engine.
* Ability to include files from within template: &amp;lt;!-- INCLUDE --&amp;gt;
* Automatic removal of empty blocks and unknown variables (methods to manually tweak/override this are also available)
* Methods for runtime addition and replacement of blocks in templates
* Callback functions (NOT RECOMMENDED, API may change in future release)
* 'Compiled' templates: the engine has to parse a template file using regular expressions to find all the blocks and variable placeholders. This is a very &quot;expensive&quot; operation and is an overkill to do on every page request: templates seldom change on production websites. Thus this feature: an internal representation of the template structure is saved into a file and this file gets loaded instead of the source one on subsequent requests (unless the source changes)

 <n>* Fix: if source template does not exist, do not load the 'prepared' one, throw an error instead.
  Thanks to Maxim Panasiuk for the report.</n>
