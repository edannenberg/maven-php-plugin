 <s>PHP5 Resolver library used to communicate with a DNS server.</s>
 <d>Provides (roughly) the same functionality as Net_DNS, but using PHP5 objects, exceptions for error handling, better sockets support.

This release is (in most cases) 2x - 10x faster than Net_DNS, as well as includes more RR's (including DNSSEC RR's), and improved sockets and streams support.</d>

 <n>- fixed a math issue with the name compress logic; this would somtimes screw up Updates with multiple RR's
- added a new test in the test suite, that validates that the domain name compression and expansion works properly</n>
