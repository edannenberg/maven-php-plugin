 <s>The phpDocumentor package provides automatic documenting of php api directly from the source.</s>
 <d>The phpDocumentor tool is a standalone auto-documentor similar to JavaDoc.
It differs from PHPDoc in that it is much faster, parses a much wider range of
php files, and comes with many customizations including 10 HTML templates,
windows help file CHM output, PDF output, and XML DocBook peardoc2 output
for use with documenting PEAR.

The project is in beta cycle, and will be adding new features before the final
release of 1.2.0.  However, the parser is very stable, the HTML Converters are
very stable, the PDF Converter is beta-quality, the CHM Converter is stable,
and the XML Converter is alpha and needs testing from users to find bugs.  Output
is generated with no PHP errors, what we need is to find errors in the generated
output.

The phpDocumentor team would like to announce the release of phpDocumentor
1.2.0 BETA 2.  This is a beta release and may have bugs and may have a different
structure from the final release.  This beta differs from 1.2.0Beta in that it
should work from pear install PhpDocumentor, and has a few bugs fixed and a few
extra features.

phpDocumentor is a JavaDoc-like automatic documentation generator for PHP
written in PHP.  It is the most versatile tool for documenting PHP.

Once again, phpDocumentor brings a great increase in usability with the 1.2
branch.  The addition of a tokenizer-based parser increases parsing speed by
up to 4 times (that's 400% faster) compared to previous versions.  In addition,
scalability has been improved, allowing generation of documents in multiple
output formats with one command.  The usage of config files makes repetitive
parsing tasks straightforward and reduces the chance for error.

The addition of DocBlock templates, extended documentation (tutorials) parsing,
and many other new features make this release the most useful automatic
documentor for any programming language.

The default HTML Converter has been ported to a new Smarty-based converter,
HTMLframesConverter, and all of the old templates have been ported to the new
Smarty-based format.  The HTMLdefaultConverter has been deprecated since its
functionality is redundant.  Due to the time it takes to convert a template to
the new format, the phpDocumentor team extends an offer to do this conversion
for anyone who has a brand new template.  We may also include the template in a
future release, if permission is granted.

Due to interest from PEAR programmers, there is a new beta-quality XML:DocBook
converter with peardoc2 templates.  This converter could also generate other
DocBook formats, if desired, but does not generate indexing for this release.

The PDF Converter has stepped up to beta-quality, is fully templatable, and
has most bugs completely fixed.  The CHM converter has also taken major strides
and is close to beta quality.

As predicted, the Smarty template engine is the primary template engine for
all converters.

For users new to phpDocumentor, phpDocumentor uses an event-driven parser
and intermediary data structures that allow it to perform at a level other
automatic documentors for PHP cannot achieve:
  --parsing any php file, with multiple classes and functions in the same file
  --fully compliant with even the most esoteric php syntax 
   ($string = &lt;&lt;&lt; EOF, for example)
  --ability to generate multiple output formats
  --extremely fast parsing
  --error/warnings by line number and file to allow for debugging of
documentation tags
  --multiple output templates to easily customize the look of generated
documentation
  --extensive documentation of the package, including a detailed specification
for tags and the included template engine
  --open source, GPL

next section of the notes

phpDocumentor 1.2.0BETA2 is not ready for production use documenting any PHP
project, although it is very stable.  Download it and try the most advanced
solution for PHP documentation today to help us find the last persistent bugs.
There are MANY in the new XML DocBook Converter.  Please try it out and find
them so we can begin to fix them.  HTML Converters are both very stable, as is
the Parser.</n>
