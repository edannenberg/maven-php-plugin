 <s>A HTML_QuickForm rule plugin that checks the spelling of its values</s>
 <d>Although browsers now have builtin spellcheckers, HTML_QuickForm_Rule_Spelling allows you to control the quality of text data submitted.

The frontend is a clientside javascript dialog that goes through the misspelt words, giving the user the option to ignore the word, add it to the dictionary or change the word given a list of suggestions.</d>

 <n>- Made a few interface changes so the rule's form elements can be used with templates easily.
- Changed default text 'Run through spelling mistakes' to 'Run through words not in dictionary'.
- Added fixed position style so dialog will remain in top right regardless of scroll position, including workaround for IE.
- The word delimiter is now settable from setOption().  This is a regular expression character class.
- Added ability to change all text from setOption().</n>
