 <s>PHP5 interface to the reCATCHA and the reCATCHA Mailhide API</s>
 <d>Services_ReCaptcha is a PHP5 interface to the two services offered by
recaptcha: reCAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA Mailhide.

reCAPTCHA is a freely available CAPTCHA implementation. It distinguishes 
humans from computers.
To use reCAPTCHA, you will need a public/private API key pair, available here:
http://recaptcha.net/api/getkey

reCAPTCHA Mailhide helps you protect your inbox by asking people to solve a
reCAPTCHA before they can view your email address.
The reCAPTCHA can only be solved by humans, so this stops spammers from gaining
access to your email address through automated programs.
reCAPTCHA Mailhide also requires a public and a private API key, that can be
generated here:
http://mailhide.recaptcha.net/apikey</d>
