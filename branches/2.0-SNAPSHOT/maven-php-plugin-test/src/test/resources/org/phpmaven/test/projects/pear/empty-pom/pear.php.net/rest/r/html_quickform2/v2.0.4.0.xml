 <s>PHP5 rewrite of HTML_QuickForm package</s>
 <d>PHP5 rewrite of HTML_QuickForm and HTML_QuickForm_Controller packages.
 
 This package provides methods to create, validate and render HTML forms.
 
 Features:
   * Supports all form elements defined by HTML standard
   * Server-side validation, several common rules provided
   * Multipage forms (tabbed forms and wizards)
   * Pluggable elements, rules, renderers and renderer plugins

 Major advantages over PHP4 version:
   * DOM-like API for building the form structure, new streamlined API for 
     elements' values handling
   * Default rendering without tables (inspired by
     HTML_QuickForm_Renderer_Tableless)
   * Renderer plugins for elements with complex rendering needs
   * Ability to chain validation rules with 'and' and 'or'</d>

 <n>Milestone 4: port of HTML_QuickForm_Controller, group rules

Major additions and changes
  * Includes a port of HTML_QuickForm_Controller. It is now possible to create
    multipage forms (wizards, tabbed forms, etc.) with HTML_QuickForm2
  * It is now possible to leverage existing rules for group validation 
    (see also request #12610)
  * Rule configuration redone, now an error for an incomplete or bogus
    configuration will be thrown immediately on adding a Rule rather than on
    validating with it. Rule::getConfig() will now return the complete
    configuration rather than a local part of it.

Features added
  * It is possible to disable &quot;intrinsic validation&quot; for select
    elements (request #13088)
  * Checkboxes named 'foo[]' properly get their values from data sources
    (request #16806)
  * Arrays generated by Array Renderer for fieldsets and groups contain 
    'type' keys (request #16937)
  * Added setElementTemplateForGroupClass() and setElementTemplateForGroupId()
    methods HTML_QuickForm2_Renderer_Default setting templates for grouped
    elements within a group of a given class or with a given id, respectively

Bug fixes
  * E_NOTICE for an undefined index could be emitted when outputting 
    a checkbox (bug #16816)

Backwards compatibility issues
  * HTML_QuickForm2_Renderer_Default::setGroupedTemplateForClass() is
    deprecated
  * If you implemented custom Rules, you should rewrite them to conform
    to the new Rule configuration approach (this may require implementing
    custom mergeConfig() and setConfig() methods) and implement 
    validateOwner() method instead of checkValue(). Old-style Rules will emit
    notices in 0.4.0 and will stop working completely in the next release.
  * Packaging changes: data/, docs/ and tests/ contents are installed without
    redundant subdirectories, e.g. quickform.css now resides in 
    @data_dir@/HTML_QuickForm2 rather than
    @data_dir@/HTML_QuickForm2/data</n>
