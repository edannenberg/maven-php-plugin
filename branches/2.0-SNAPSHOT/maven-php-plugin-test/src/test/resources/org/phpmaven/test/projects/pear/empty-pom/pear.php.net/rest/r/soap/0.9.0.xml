 <n>- Fix #3456

- SOAP_Base now has a $_namespace property for the object's default namespace (included as xmlns=&quot;foo&quot;, and given no ns prefix).

- If a name has more than one colon, don't split it as a prefix:foo QName, treat it as a namespace name instead.

- Never put a colon in if a namespace prefix is empty.

- SOAP_Header objects can take regular SOAP_Value attributes.

- validateString() is not a NOP anymore.

- E_ALL warnings during WSDL parsing are fixed.

- ref=&quot;&quot; elements in WSDL are correctly treated as QNames now.

- Save the outgoing payload when sending by HTTPS as well as by HTTP (for tracing).

- Avoid infinite loops when wsdl:import files create a circular dependency.

- Provide a mechanism in SOAP_WSDL to turn on documentation parsing in SOAP_WSDL_Parser objects.

- Pass $this-&gt;docs to child SOAP_WSDL_Parser objects.

- Successfully parse the &lt;schema&gt; sections of XSD documents imported via &lt;wsdl:import&gt;.

- Allow overriding the name of the class used for WSDL parsing.

- Never try to redefine SOAP_Client_Overload.

- Fix PEAR bug #4063 - correctly mark NULLs in request XML.

- Fix PEAR bug #4074 - overwriting of some arguments in proxy code.

- Allow overriding the WSDL endpoint in generated proxy classes (PEAR bug #4076).

- Fix PEAR bug #4062 - decode base64-encoded data.

- Fix PEAR bug #953 - stop code flow and return SOAP fault on errors in userland code.

- Fix PEAR bug #1657 - create WSDL element in the correct order.

- Fix PEAR bug #2694 - don't use return element for single, simple return values.</n>
