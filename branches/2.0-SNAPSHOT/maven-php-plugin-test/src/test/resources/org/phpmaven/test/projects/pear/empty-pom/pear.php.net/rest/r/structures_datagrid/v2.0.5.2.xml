 <s>A tabular structure that contains a record set of data for paging and sorting purposes.</s>
 <d>This package offers a toolkit to render out a datagrid in HTML format as well as
many other formats such as an XML Document, an Excel Spreadsheet, a Smarty Template and more.
It also offers paging and sorting functionallity to limit the data that is presented.
This concept is based on the .NET Framework DataGrid control and works very well with database and XML result sets.

 <n>This release is to be the final Alpha release (hopefully).

Added rendered variable and setRendered methods in Renderer classes (Bertrand)
Fixed Record Drivers to work with PHP 5 (Bug #1739)
Moved require statement for the Pager class for more optimization (Bug #2027) 
Fixed undefined offset warning, again :) (Bug #1545)
