More API changes to come, but so far, they're minimal. I'm getting
things cleaned up so that the upcoming SQL frontend will fit nicely.

* Schema format has changed; use DBA_* constants rather than
  strings to organize meta data. See example schemas.
* Dropped support for autodecrement; initialize autoincrement by
  supplying a default value rather than using the keyword 'init'
* Fixed-length char type support added, varchar preallocates
  space in DBA driver if size is supplied
* Fixed some problems with inserting on tables when no primary
  key was specified
* Added DBA_Toolbox.php to hold utility functions that are
  not necessary for working with DBA, just useful.</n>
