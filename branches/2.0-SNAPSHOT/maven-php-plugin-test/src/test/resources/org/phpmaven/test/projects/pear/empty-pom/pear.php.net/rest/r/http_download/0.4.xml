 <s>Send HTTP Downloads</s>
 <d>Provides an easy interface to send hidden files or any arbitrary data to the client over HTTP. It features HTTP Caching, Compression and Ranges (partial downloads and resuming).

NOTE:
Don't use with PHP's on-the-fly output compression, because files may be sent corrupted.

 <n>* Bugfix (HTTP): 'Last-Modified' was sent as unix timestamp instead of HTTP date
* Bugfix (HTTP Range): conditional GET requests didn't come through because of wrong 'Last-Modified'
* Bugfix (HTTP Range): 'Content-Length' MUST contain the ACTUAL length of the body
* Bugfix (HTTP Range): 'Content-Range' was sent incorrectly (though Apache usually overrules that)
* Bugfix (HTTP Range): 'HTTP 200 Ok' was sent instead of 'HTTP 206 Partial Content' (though Apache usually overrules that)

* Modified the PCRE of setContentType() to allow additions like '; charset=UTF-8'
* Added a check if ext/mime_magic is configured with a valid filename (avoiding fatal error)</n>
