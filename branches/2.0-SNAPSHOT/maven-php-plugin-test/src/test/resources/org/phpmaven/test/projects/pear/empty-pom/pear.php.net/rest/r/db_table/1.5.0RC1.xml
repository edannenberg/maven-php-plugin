 <s>An object oriented interface to a database, which is a wrapper for PEAR DB or 
MDB2. It provides methods to help build insert, update, delete, and select 
SQL commands, to automate construction of join conditions, to create or verify
database tables, and to automatically build input forms with HTML_Quickform.</s>
 <d>The DB_Table package provides an object oriented interface to a database. Each 
instance of the core DB_Table class contains the schema for a table, defined 
using abstract data types. The class provides a portable api for building insert, 
update, delete, and select SQL commands, and can validate data types upon 
insertion and updating. DB_Table also provides methods to automatically create 
or verify a database table, and (using PEAR HTML_Quickform) to generate input 
forms that match the column definitions. Each instance of the DB_Table_Database 
class contains a model of relationships between tables in a database, in which 
each table is represented by an instance of DB_Table. DB_Table_Database 
provides automatic construction of join conditions for inner joins involving 
any number of tables, optional php validation of foreign key validity, and 
optional php emulation of actions triggered on delete or update of referenced
rows, such as cascading deletes.</d>

 <n>- New DB_Table_Database class added to package. The new class provides a model 
  of foreign key relationships between tables in a database, and features that 
  depend on knowledge of these relationships. User documentation for this 
  class is provided in docs/database/manual.html. 
- Added auto-increment feature to DB_Table insert() method. The value of a new
  $auto_inc_col property is the name of an auto-increment column (if any) or 
  null. 
- added toXML() method to DB_Table, which emits the table schema in the MDB2 
  XML DTD, with an extension to describe foreign key references. This method 
  is called by the toXML() method of DB_Table_Database, which emits an XML 
  schema string for an entire database.</n>
