 <s>database abstraction layer</s>
 <d>PEAR MDB is a merge of the PEAR DB and Metabase php database abstraction layers.
It provides a common API for all support RDBMS. The main difference to most other DB abstraction packages is that MDB goes much further to ensure portability. Among other things MDB features:
* An OO-style query API
* A DSN (data source name) or array format for specifying database servers
* Datatype abstraction and on demand datatype conversion
* Portable error codes
* Sequential and non sequential row fetching as well as bulk fetching
* Ordered array and associative array for the fetched rows
* Prepare/execute (bind) emulation
* Sequence emulation
* Replace emulation
* Limited Subselect emulation
* Row limit support
* Transactions support
* Large Object support
* Index/Unique support
* Module Framework to load advanced functionality on demand
* Table information interface
* RDBMS management methods (creating, dropping, altering)
* RDBMS independent xml based schema definition management
* Altering of a DB from a changed xml schema
* Reverse engineering of xml schemas from an existing DB (currently only MySQL)
* Full integration into the PEAR Framework
* Wrappers for the PEAR DB and Metabase APIs
* PHPDoc API documentation
Currently supported RDBMS:
MySQL
PostGreSQL
Oracle
Frontbase
Querysim
Interbase/Firebird
MSSQL
Other soon to follow.

- fixed bug in test suite (user_id was incorrectly set to type text instead of integer)
- added a test for MDB::singleton()
MDB_Common:
- fixed bug in support() that would result in always returning true
- fixed bug in getValue() when $type is empty
