 <s>Provides an easy way to perform HTTP requests.</s>
 <d>PHP5 rewrite of HTTP_Request package. Provides cleaner API and pluggable
Adapters. Currently available are:
  * Socket adapter, based on old HTTP_Request code,
  * Curl adapter, wraps around PHP's cURL extension,
  * Mock adapter, to use for testing packages dependent on HTTP_Request2.
Supports POST requests with data and file uploads, basic and digest 
authentication, cookies, proxies, gzip and deflate encodings, monitoring 
the request progress with Observers...</d>

 <n>API changes:
 * Removed HTTP_Request2::getConfigValue() method

Feature additions:
 * Added digest authentication (RFC 2617) support to Socket adapter. Thanks
   to Tom Snyder (tomsn at inetoffice dot com) who sent me a prototype
   implementation for HTTP_Request a couple of years ago.
 * Added HTTPS proxy support to Socket adapter, this works through CONNECT
   request described in RFC 2817.
 * Mock adapter can now throw an Exception instead of returning a response
   if Exception object is added via its addResponse() method (request #15629)

Other changes and fixes:
 * Support RFC 3986 by not encoding '~' in POST body (request #15368)
 * Prevent an error with particular versions of PHP and Curl (bug #15617)
 * Regular expressions used in HTTP_Request2 are now class constants 
   (request #15630)
 * Curl adapter now throws an exception in case of malformed (non-HTTP) 
   response rather than dies with a fatal error (bug #15716)
 * Curl handle wasn't closed in Curl adapter in case of error (bug #15721)
 * Curl adapter sent an extra 'sentHeaders' event and returned bogus 
   response status when server returned 100-Continue response (bug #15785)</n>
