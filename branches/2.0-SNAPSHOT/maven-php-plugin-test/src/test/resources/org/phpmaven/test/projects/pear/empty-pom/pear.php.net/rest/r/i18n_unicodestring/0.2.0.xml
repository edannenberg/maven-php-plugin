 <n>This is a long overdue release that includes some feature requests. Notably, per request of Lukas Feiler, the method to convert from UTF-8 to an array of integers representing UCS-4 and the method to convert a single Unicode character to its UTF-8 representation have been made static. Also I included a patch from Jonathan Yavner that allows HTML entities to be inputted in &amp;#xNNNN form where NNNN is the hexadecimal notation for the Unicode character.</n>
