 <s>Resolver library used to communicate with a DNS server</s>
 <d>A resolver library used to communicate with a name server to perform DNS queries, zone transfers, dynamic DNS updates, etc.  Creates an object hierarchy from a DNS server's response, which allows you to view all of the information given by the DNS server.  It bypasses the system's resolver library and communicates directly with the server.

 <n>Now has stable support of DNS queries, socket handling, and packet parsing/generating.  Any problems at this point should be considered bugs and should be reported ASAP.  Running this code with E_ALL should be acceptable -- any warnings generated should be submitted to eric@ypass.net.</n>
