 <s>translate grammar files in Lemon Parser Generator format into a PHP 5 parser</s>
 <d>Translate a grammar file in the lemon parser generator format
  into a PHP 5-based parser
  
  There are a few PHP-specific changes to the lemon parser generator.
  
  - %extra_argument is removed, as class constructor can be used to
    pass in extra information
  - %token_type and company are irrelevant in PHP, and so are removed
  - %declare_class is added to define the parser class name and any
    implements/extends information
  - %include_class is added to allow insertion of extra class information
    such as constants, a class constructor, etc.

  Other changes make the parser more robust, and also make reporting
  syntax errors simpler.  Detection of expected tokens eliminates some
  problematic edge cases where an unexpected token could cause the parser
  to simply accept input.
  
  Otherwise, the file format is identical to the Lemon parser generator</d>
