 <s>Logging utilities</s>
 <d>The Log framework provides an abstracted logging system.  It supports logging to console, file, syslog, SQL, Sqlite, mail and mcal targets.  It also provides a subject - observer mechanism.

 <n>Added stringToPriority() for converting priority names to PEAR_LOG_* constants.
The mail handler now uses \r\n instead of \n to terminate lines.
The file handler will now perform file locking if the 'locking' parameter is set.
The file hander's directory creation routines have been rewritten.
The file handler will now set a created directory's permission mode based on the 'dirmode' parameter.
The SQL handler can now be configured with an array of DB 'options'.
The SQL handler now uses prepared queries for improved performance.
An MDB2 database handler has been added.
Only variable references should be returned by reference in Log::factory().
The file handler can now handle file modes given as strings.
The display handler now offers a 'linebreak' configuration option.
The composite handler's getIdent() method now returns the correct value.
The file handler now only attempts to set the log file's mode if it created it.
The factory() method will no longer attempt to include the handler file if the handler class has already been defined.</n>
