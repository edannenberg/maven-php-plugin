 <n>* Re-added request #4610 to add a 'label' key to column
definitions.  this is in addition to the 'qf_label' key;
the qf_label key is for form labels, but the label key is
for column headers on tabular formats.

* Feature request #4941: new &quot;qf_label_append&quot; key for
columns that will be displayed after (adv)checkbox
QuickForm elements.

* Bugfix: QuickForm's date &quot;element&quot; is a group, therefore
we have to use addGroupRule() instead of addRule() for such
elements; this also fixes a bug with non-standard rules
when only an error message was given in the rule definition
(missing $format param).

* Feature request #5029: new &quot;qf_filters&quot; key for columns
that applies filters to DB_Table generated forms; with the
new $formFilters parameter in getForm() one can apply
filters to all form elements
(thanks to ieure at php dot net)

* Optimized some pieces of code and applied Coding Standards

* Bug #5060: Empty fields were wrongly casted to null it they
were required. Also making the casting to null for date and
time values work correctly.

* Added smart handling of non-standard (i.e. Y-m-d) date
formats, this allows to use two-digit years (y) and short (M)
or long (F) names of months without having to recast the date
value yourself.</n>
