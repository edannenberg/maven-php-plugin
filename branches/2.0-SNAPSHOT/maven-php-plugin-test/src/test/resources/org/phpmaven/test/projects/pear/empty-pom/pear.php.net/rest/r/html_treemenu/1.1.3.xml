 <s>Provides an api to create a HTML tree</s>
 <d>PHP Based api creates a tree structure using a couple of
small PHP classes. This can then be converted to javascript
using the printMenu() method. The tree is  dynamic in
IE 4 or higher and NN6/Mozilla, and maintains state
(the collapsed/expanded status of the branches) by using cookies.
Other browsers display the tree fully expanded. Each node can
have an optional link and icon. New API in 1.1 with many changes
(see CVS for changelog) and new features, of which most came
from Chip Chapin (http://www.chipchapin.com).

 <n>Added expanded icon support. Added documentation in Word
and PDF formats. Moved structure import code to its own
static method createFromStructure(), and added support
for my own Tree class (http://phpguru.org/tree.html) as
well as Wolfram Kriesings Tree class.</n>
