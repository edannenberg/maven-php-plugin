 <s>A tabular structure that contains a record set of data for paging and sorting purposes.</s>
 <d>This package offers a toolkit to render out a datagrid in HTML format as well as
many other formats such as an XML Document, an Excel Spreadsheet, an XUL Document and more.
It also offers paging and sorting functionallity to limit the data that is presented and processed.
This concept is based on the .NET Framework DataGrid control and works very well with database and XML result sets.</d>

 <n>- The usage of constants for selecting DataSource or Renderer driver is now
  deprecated. Use the name of the driver instead (e.g. CSV, DB_Table, Smarty).
  For some drivers there exist also more logical names like 'Excel' (instead of
  'XLS'). Names like 'HTML_Table' (name of the PEAR package) and 'HTMLTable'
  (name of the Structures_DataGrid driver) are both allowed.
- Bug #8005: fill() did not pass options to the renderer
  (thanks to Daniel Rossi, pear at electroteque dot org)
- use native http_build_query() if PHP 5 is installed
- Request #8061:
  added getDataSource(), made datasourceFactory() public 
  added getter and setter methods for all column object attributes
  fixed non-static call in dataSourceFactory()
  (thanks to Markus Ernst, derernst at gmx dot ch)
- Request #7969: added example to the fill() method 
  (thanks to Benny Labach, bennythebee at gmail dot com)
- Request #8089: fixed the DataSource class documentation
  (thanks to Michel D'HOOGE, michel dot dhooge at gmail dot com)
- Request #8320: new removeColumn() method
  (thanks to Arcadius, arcadius at menelic dot com)
- fixed calculation of the number of the last record
- fixed internal usage of the page number that was either given via the second
  constructor parameter or via the 'page' GET variable: if it is too low or too
  high, it is now resetted to 1 (&quot;too low&quot; means: the given page number is lower
  than 1; &quot;too high&quot; means: the real page count is lower than the given page
  number)
- fixed handling of column attributes for the Smarty renderer</n>
