 <s>Generic tree management, currently supports DB and XML as data sources</s>
 <d>Provides methods to read and manipulate trees, which are stored in the DB
or an XML file. The trees can be stored in the DB either as nested trees.
Or as simple trees ('brain dead method'), which use parentId-like structure.
Currently XML data can only be read from a file and accessed.
The package offers a big number of methods to access and manipulate trees.
For example methods like: getRoot, getChild[ren[Ids]], getParent[s[Ids]], getPath[ById] and many
more.
There are two ways of retreiving the data from the place where they are stored,
one is by reading the entire tree into the memory - the Memory way. The other
is reading the tree nodes as needed (very useful in combination with huge trees
and the nested set model).
The package is designed that way that it is possible to convert/copy tree data
from either structure to another (from XML into DB).

 <n>* Make switchDataSource work for Memory/Array, this enables you to
read the data from any source and switch the source on the run. This writes the data 
from the current tree into the new source. I.e. you read the data from a DB and write
it into an array. 
Switching from DB to Array makes sense i.e. if you read a tree from the DB, which you want to show
(i.e. using HTML_TreeMenu) but therefore you need to set additional properties for each
node which you don't want to save in the DB, since they are only for the presentation.
Properties for HTML_TreeMenu are i.e. the icon and some events (like 'onClick'). Since you switched 
the source from DB to Array you can change any data without worrying that they are written into
the DB and modify your actual data in the DB.
* Bring Memory/Array closer to be fully useable.
* getPathAsString() takes two more parameters where you can determine from and offset
* getChildrenIds() has a new optional parameter for determining the level
* Add getDepth() to determine the maximum depth of the tree
* Make setup work with custom data optionally (only relevant for Memory_*)
* Show a nicer varDump
* add UML class diagram</n>
