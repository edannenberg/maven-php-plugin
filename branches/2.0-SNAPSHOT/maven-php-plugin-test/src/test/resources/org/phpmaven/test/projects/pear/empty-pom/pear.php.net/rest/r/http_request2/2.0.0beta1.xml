 <s>Provides an easy way to perform HTTP requests.</s>
 <d>PHP5 rewrite of HTTP_Request package (with parts of HTTP_Client). Provides
cleaner API and pluggable Adapters:
  * Socket adapter, based on old HTTP_Request code,
  * Curl adapter, wraps around PHP's cURL extension,
  * Mock adapter, to use for testing packages dependent on HTTP_Request2.
Supports POST requests with data and file uploads, basic and digest 
authentication, cookies, managing cookies across requests, proxies, gzip and
deflate encodings, redirects, monitoring the request progress with Observers...</d>

 <n>Additions and changes:
  * Implemented cookie jar that allows to store and pass cookies across HTTP
    requests (see request #18225)
  * Added several specialized subclasses of HTTP_Request2_Exception, they are
    now thrown instead of the parent. Also added error codes and possibility
    to get native error code (as returned by stream_socket_client() and 
    curl_errno()) (request #16762)
  * An additional 'sentBody' event is now sent to Observers (request #16828) 
  * setBody() and addUpload() can now accept file pointers (request #16863)

Bugfixes:
  * Incorrect check in Socket Adapter prevented Keep-alive from working in
    some cases (bug #17031)</n>
