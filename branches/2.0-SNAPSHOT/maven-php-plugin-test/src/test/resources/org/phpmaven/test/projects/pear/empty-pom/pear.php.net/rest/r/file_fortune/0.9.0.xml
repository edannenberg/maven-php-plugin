 <s>File_Fortune and File_Fortune_Writer provide an interface for reading from and writing to fortune files.</s>
 <d>File_Fortune provides a PHP interface to reading fortune files. With it, you may
retrieve a single fortune, a random fortune, or all fortunes in the file.

File_Fortune_Writer provides an interface for manipulating the contents of a
fortune file. It allows you to write a complete fortune file and the associated
binary header file from an array of fortunes. You may also add fortunes, delete
fortunes, or update individual fortunes in a fortune file. All write operations
will produce a binary header file to allow for greater compatability with the
fortune and fortune-mod programs (as well as other fortune interfaces).</d>
