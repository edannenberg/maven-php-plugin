 <s>Object oriented interface for searching and manipulating LDAP-entries</s>
 <d>Net_LDAP2 is the successor of Net_LDAP which is a clone of Perls Net::LDAP
                object interface to directory servers. It does contain most of Net::LDAPs
                features but has some own too.
                 With Net_LDAP2 you have:
                 * A simple object-oriented interface to connections, searches entries and filters.
                 * Support for tls and ldap v3.
                 * Simple modification, deletion and creation of ldap entries.
                 * Support for schema handling.

                 Net_LDAP2 layers itself on top of PHP's existing ldap extensions.</d>

 <n>* Implemented PHP5 language stuff (thanks to Torsten Roehr for his helpful patches)
* Changed Net_LDAP2-&gt;_markAsNew() to public access, since this is required by the api
  and may be useful to developers too
* Changed API to create schema object, there is now a factory. Net_LDAP2-&gt;schema() calls
  that factory now instead of fetching the Schema itself
* Changed API to create rootDSE object, there is now a factory. Net_LDAP2-&gt;rootDSE() calls
  that factory now instead of fetching the rootDSE itself
* Net_LDAP2_Entry has a new factory constructor: createConnected() can be used to
  establish a new Net_LDAP2_Entry object that represents an already existing entry inside
  some directory</n>
