 <s>make-rpm-spec command for managing RPM .spec files for PEAR packages</s>
 <d>This command is an improved implementation of the standard 'makerpm' command,
  and contains several enhancements that make it far more flexible. Similar 
  functions for other external packaging mechanisms may be added at a later date.

  Enhanced features over the original PEAR &amp;amp;quot;makerpm&amp;amp;quot; command include:
  
  - Ability to define a release on the command line
  - Allows more advanced customisation of the generated package name
  - Allows virtual Provides/Requires that differ in format from the package name
    format 
  - tries to intelligently distinguish between PEAR and PECL when generating 
    packages</d>
