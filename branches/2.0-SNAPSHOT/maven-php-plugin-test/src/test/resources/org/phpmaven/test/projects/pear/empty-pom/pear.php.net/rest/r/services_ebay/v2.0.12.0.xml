 <s>Interface to eBay's XML-API.</s>
 <d>Interface to eBay's XML-API. It provides objects that are able to communicate with eBay as well as models that help you working with the return values like User or Item models.
The Services_Ebay class provides a unified method to use all objects.

 <n>Services_Ebay now always encodes data in UTF-8, as requested by the eBay webservice. You can still use ISO-8859-1 encoding in your scripts as all encoding and decoding is done automatically.
If you like to switch off this feature, you can tell the session-object that your data already is UTF-8 encoded and that you want UTF-8 encoded data in return.
- Added new getErrors() method to Services_Ebay session which will return an array of Services_Ebay_Error objects containing information about all warnings and serious errors (schst)
- fixed bug #4181: Only serious errors will be thrown as exceptions (schst)
- fixed bug #4296: UTF-8 encoding (schst)
- fixed bug #4326: wrong variable name (schst)
- fixed bug #4420: wrong capitalization in example (amt)</n>
