 <n>ATTENTION: The 1.2 api may not be fully backward compatible to the current 1.3 api. To avoid surprises when we go stable please make sure that you test this release 
candidate with your 1.2 apps.
Please look at http://pear.php.net/package/DB_NestedSet/download/1.3 for informations on the major changes between
the 1.2 and the 1.3+ releases.

The 1.3.6 release is used in many projects and is considered to be quite solid.
This release fixes some minor bugs. Finally there is also an end user documentation available!
Thanks to Lukas Linemayr (ll@shopping.at) for writing and maintaining them.
I'd also like to thank tacker (http://pear.php.net/user/tacker) for providing lots of bug reports and patches.
If everything goes well this will be the last beta release. Please test it and report every problem you have with it!
