 <s>Show Information about your PEAR install and its packages</s>
 <d>This package generates a comprehensive information page for your current PEAR install.
* The format for the page is similar to that for phpinfo() except using PEAR colors.
* Has complete PEAR Credits (based on the packages you have installed).
* Will show if there is a newer version than the one presently installed (and what its state is)
* Each package has an anchor in the form pkg_PackageName - where PackageName is a case-sensitive PEAR package name</d>

 <n>IMPORTANT NOTE
Even if this version is mark as alpha, I consider API as stable. There are no change
on Web SAPI.
Introduce the CLI part: a phpinfo() text clone like, but for PEAR info.

Final and stable release is planned for April 18, 2008 with same features. Unless
a bug is found or a change is asked by users-end.

* news
- implement request #13401 : outputs plain text in CLI mode</n>
