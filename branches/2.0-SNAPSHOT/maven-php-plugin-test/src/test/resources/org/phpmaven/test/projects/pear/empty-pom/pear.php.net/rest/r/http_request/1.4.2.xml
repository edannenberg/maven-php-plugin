 <n>* The final CRLF was not properly added to request headers on POST request 
  with no post data (Thanks to Brock Weaver)
* Added error codes (request #12335, thanks to Joe Stump for the patch)
* HTTP_Request sent broken requests on redirects with no trailing slash
  (bug #12308, thanks to Joe Stump for the patch)
* Requests with a body consisting of only a symbol '0' were sent without body
  (reported privately by Sam Ghods)
* download-progress.php example was broken since 1.4.0 due to addition of 
  'connect' and 'disconnect' events. Now works again.</n>
