 <s>Provides an easy way to perform HTTP requests.</s>
 <d>PHP5 rewrite of HTTP_Request package. Provides cleaner API and pluggable
Adapters. Currently available are:
  * Socket adapter, based on old HTTP_Request code,
  * Curl adapter, wraps around PHP's cURL extension,
  * Mock adapter, to use for testing packages dependent on HTTP_Request2.
Supports POST requests with data and file uploads, basic and digest 
authentication, cookies, proxies, gzip and deflate encodings, redirects,
monitoring the request progress with Observers...</d>

 <n>Additions and changes:
  * Added test suite that interacts with a webserver. Please refer to 
    tests/NetworkConfig.php.dist for instructions.
  * Packaging changes: docs/ and tests/ contents are installed without
    redundant subdirectories.
  * Added a $replace parameter to HTTP_Request2::setHeader() that controls
    whether new header value will overwrite previous one or be appended
    to it (request #17507)

Bugfixes:
  * Fixed a typo in Curl Adapter that prevented 'strict_redirects' from working
  * Curl Adapter will throw an exception if CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION can not be
    enabled due to PHP setup (bug #17450)
  * Allow parameters in manually set Content-Type headers (bug #17460)
  * Properly reset redirect limit if multiple requests are performed with the
    same instance of Socket Adapter (bug #17826)
  * Response::getBody() no longer tries to decode empty strings (bug #18169)</n>
