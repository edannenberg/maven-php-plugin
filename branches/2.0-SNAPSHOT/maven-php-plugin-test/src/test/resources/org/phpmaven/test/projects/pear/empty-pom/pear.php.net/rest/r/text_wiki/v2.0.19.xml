 <n>* WARNING: This release represents a major BC break in the API and organization.
* WARNING: Do not expect to upgrade in-place and have everything work.
* WARNING: Read these notes carefully, you will need to re-work how you configure the Text_Wiki object.
* Directory structure is competely different but should lend itself to easier extensibility
* Rules are now split up: one class for parse, another class for each render-format
* Formats themselves (XHTML, DocBook, Plain, etc) have their own class and get their own pre- and post-render methods
* Instead of set/getRuleConf(), mostly use set/getRenderConf() instead
* Wikilinks parser uses numbers as lower-case letters
* List parser has better token type names
* Xhtml List renders with proper semantics for nested lists (per notes from Michael Wallner and others)
* Xhtml List and Table renderers apply CSS classes now instead of inline attributes
* NOTE: Documentation on this new Text_Wiki is not yet complete</n>
