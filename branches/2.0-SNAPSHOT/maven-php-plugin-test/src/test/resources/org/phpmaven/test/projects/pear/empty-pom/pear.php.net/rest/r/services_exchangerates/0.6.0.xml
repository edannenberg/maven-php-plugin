 <s>Performs currency conversion</s>
 <d>Extendable to work with any source that provides exchange rate data, this class downloads
exchange rates and the name of each currency (US Dollar, Euro, Maltese Lira, etc.) and 
converts between any two of the available currencies (the actual number of currencies 
supported depends on the exchange rate feed used).</d>
 <da>2009-01-17 11:40:24</da>
 <n>Major refactoring of class to allow for dependency injection, and decoupled code.
Added unit test coverage.
Added the ability to choose from either Cached HTTP, file_get_contents(), or simulated data fetching
Removed dead code - Countries_UN
Be aware: You'll have to update code which was using 0.5.X API!</n>
