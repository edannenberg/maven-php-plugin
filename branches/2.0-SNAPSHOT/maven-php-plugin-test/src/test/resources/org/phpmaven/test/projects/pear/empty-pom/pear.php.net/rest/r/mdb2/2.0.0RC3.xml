 <s>database abstraction layer</s>
 <d>PEAR MDB2 is a merge of the PEAR DB and Metabase php database abstraction layers.

Note that the API will be adapted to better fit with the new php5 only PDO
before the first stable release.

It provides a common API for all supported RDBMS. The main difference to most
other DB abstraction packages is that MDB2 goes much further to ensure
portability. Among other things MDB2 features:
* An OO-style query API
* A DSN (data source name) or array format for specifying database servers
* Datatype abstraction and on demand datatype conversion
* Various optional fetch modes to fix portability issues
* Portable error codes
* Sequential and non sequential row fetching as well as bulk fetching
* Ability to make buffered and unbuffered queries
* Ordered array and associative array for the fetched rows
* Prepare/execute (bind) emulation
* Sequence emulation
* Replace emulation
* Limited sub select emulation
* Row limit support
* Transactions support
* Large Object support
* Index/Unique Key/Primary Key support
* Autoincrement emulation
* Module framework to load advanced functionality on demand
* Ability to read the information schema
* RDBMS management methods (creating, dropping, altering)
* Reverse engineering schemas from an existing DB
* SQL function call abstraction
* Full integration into the PEAR Framework
* PHPDoc API documentation

 <n>- added error handling when result set introspection is not supported in _wrapResult()
- fixed example
- removed peardb wrapper (its broken, unmaintained and probably unused)
- added new example using php5 only features
- MDB2_OK is now a boolean true, instead of integer 1
- types can now always be keyed by name or by order
- renamed setResultTypes() in the datatype module to checkResultTypes()
  and modified the signature accordingly
- removed no longer used MDB2::isManip()</n>
