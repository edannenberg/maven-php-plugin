 <s>The add-on to HTML_QuickForm package that allows building of multipage forms</s>
 <d>The package is essentially an implementation of a PageController pattern.
Architecture:
* Controller class that examines HTTP requests and manages form values persistence across requests.
* Page class (subclass of QuickForm) representing a single page of the form.
* Business logic is contained in subclasses of Action class.
Cool features:
* Includes several default Actions that allow easy building of multipage forms.
* Includes usage examples for common usage cases (single-page form, wizard, tabbed form).

 <n>* HTML_QuickForm_Controller does not rely on form's &quot;name&quot; attribute anymore
  (XHTML compliance fix, see also bug #925)
* Use new HTML_QuickForm::arrayMerge() method in place of PHP's builtin
  array_merge(), depend on QuickForm 3.2.2
* Applied patch from #929, exportValues() does not overwrite elements with
  the same names from different pages.</n>
