 <n>* Use $_POST, $_GET and $_FILES instead of $HTTP_.
* Better error checking in renderElement().
* Fixed freeze() for removed elements.
* Added new element 'hiddenselect'.
* Added optional $in_data parameter to method toHtml so that data can be added to the form right before it is rendered.  Useful when using with a template system.
* Changed the way the key is obtained for _elementIndex in addElement() to accomodate with removeElement().
* Some changes to _buildRules(): Made some of the javascript variables private which did not need have a global scope (such as frm).
* Added new rule: emailorblank.
* Fixes in HTML_QuickForm_Element.
* Fixes in QuickForm_example2.php.
* Added getElements() in HTML_QuickForm_Group which returns an array of all elements in group by reference.
* Added getGroupType() in HTML_QuickForm_Group which returns the type of group as string or 'mixed' if group is composed of different element types.
* Fixes in file upload validation rules.
* Added a few new examples for filters, rules, file uploads usage.</n>
