 <s>Provides an easy way to perform HTTP requests.</s>
 <d>PHP5 rewrite of HTTP_Request package (with parts of HTTP_Client). Provides
cleaner API and pluggable Adapters:
  * Socket adapter, based on old HTTP_Request code,
  * Curl adapter, wraps around PHP's cURL extension,
  * Mock adapter, to use for testing packages dependent on HTTP_Request2.
Supports POST requests with data and file uploads, basic and digest 
authentication, cookies, managing cookies across requests, proxies, gzip and
deflate encodings, redirects, monitoring the request progress with Observers...</d>

 <n>* Added getEffectiveUrl() method to Response object, it returns the URL
  response was received from, possibly after redirects (request #18412)
* Curl Adapter didn't send body for PUT requests sometimes (bug #18421)</n>
