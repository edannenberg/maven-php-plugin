    <notes>After a month of testing (thanks to all applying patches and trying this class) a release in beta stadium is provided. I think that the class is quite stable, but another 1 or 2 month of testing and using the class has to proof that. There was only one issue concerning the classes API so I decided to leave the API as is. The API will not change anymore except adding optional parameters, so that the usage will be backwards-compatible. This release includes some main and minor bugfixes (feel free to send me some bugreports if you find any more) and some cool new features: The class uses now ftp_nb_{get||set}-functions, if available. Otherwise it will fall back into ftp_{get||put}-functions. Another cool thing is to create remote-directories recursively. I fixed an issue in documentation. Because of a little time-problem the official PEAR documentation will last for a while. If anyone has the time to create some docu or example, feel free to email it to me! That'll be pretty cool. Next greater feature wil be usage of socket-technologies, if ftp-support is missing, but that will have to last because of my time-problem.</notes>
