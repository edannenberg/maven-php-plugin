 <s>Class for put mails in queue and send them later in background.</s>
 <d>Class to handle mail queue managment.
Wrapper for PEAR::Mail and PEAR::DB (or PEAR::MDB).
It can load, save and send saved mails in background
and also backup some mails.

The Mail_Queue class puts mails in a temporary
container waiting to be fed to the MTA (Mail Transport Agent)
and send them later (eg. every few minutes) by crontab or in other way.

 <n>- Error management has been rewritten. New error constants are used,
  so custom error mgmt is now possible.
- Added a &quot;pearErrorMode&quot; option to specify what to do with Pear_Error
  (was: PEAR_ERROR_PRINT by default)
- Added a &quot;sequence&quot; container option to specify the name of the sequence table.
- Moved Mail_Queue_Error class from Mail/Queue/Error.php to Mail/Queue.php.
- Preloading management has been rewritten. The amount of memory used by the
  internal buffer can be limited to any chosen value via the setBufferSize() method.
- The put() methods now returns last_inserted_id instead of true
- Fixed error in factorySendMail()
- Fixed: mails weren't set as send when bypassing the queue using sendMailById()
- Fixed: Mail_Queue_Container_mdb didn't accept a 'dsn' as option
- PHP 5 fixes</n>
