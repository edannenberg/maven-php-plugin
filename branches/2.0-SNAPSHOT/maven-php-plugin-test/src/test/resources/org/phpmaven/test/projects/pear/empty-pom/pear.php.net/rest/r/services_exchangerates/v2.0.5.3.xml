 <s>Performs currency conversion</s>
 <d>Extendable to work with any source that provides exchange rate data, this class downloads
exchange rates and the name of each currency (US Dollar, Euro, Maltese Lira, etc.) and 
converts between any two of the available currencies (the actual number of currencies 
supported depends on the exchange rate feed used).

* Fixed character encoding problems in package.xml (reported by danielc)
  [mroch] [cross 11/22/2005]
* Updated XML Struct to be inline with ECB and UN changes [cross]
* Added boolean second argument to convert() to allow the user to disable 
  formatting [mroch]
