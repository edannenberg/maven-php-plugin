 <s>Provides a c-client backend for webmail.</s>
 <d>Mail_IMAP provides a simplified backend for working with the c-client (IMAP) extension. It serves as an OO wrapper for commonly used c-client functions. It provides structure and header parsing as well as body retrieval.
Mail_IMAP provides a simple inbox example that demonstrates its ability to parse and view simple and multipart email messages.
Mail_IMAP also provides a connection wizard to determine the correct protocol and port settings for a remote mail server, all you need to provide is a server, a username and a password.
Mail_IMAP may be used as a webmail backend or as a component in a mailing list manager.
This package requires the c-client extension.  To download the latest version of the c-client extension goto: http://www.php.net/imap.

 <n>Added $retreive_all argument to Mail_IMAP::getParts, this allows all
sub-attachments, inline parts, etc to be viewed at the top level.
Bug with error reporting in Mail_IMAP::getMailboxes
CS - Mail_IMAP::debug
NOTICE level errors coming from Mail_IMAP::getQuota
Patch to Mail_IMAP::getMailboxes applied.
Thanks to Matthew Schumacher for writing the original function and patch.
Debug functionality called automatically by $_GET method may now only be
called if MAIL_IMAP_ERROR_REPORTING == E_ALL.
Mail_IMAP::getMailboxInfo added, this method is automatically called by
Mail_IMAP::connect by default. Use MAIL_IMAP_NO_INFO in the $options
argument of Mail_IMAP::connect to turn this off.
Improved styling of IMAP.inbox.php example.</n>
