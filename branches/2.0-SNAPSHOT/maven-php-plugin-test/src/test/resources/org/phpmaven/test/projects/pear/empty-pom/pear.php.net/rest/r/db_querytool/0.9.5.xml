 <s>An OO-interface for easily retreiving and modifying data in a DB.</s>
 <d>This package is an OO-abstraction to the SQL-Query language, it provides methods such
as setWhere, setOrder, setGroup, setJoin, etc. to easily build queries.
It also provides an easy to learn interface that interacts nicely with HTML-forms using
arrays that contain the column data, that shall be updated/added in a DB.
This package bases on an SQL-Builder which lets you easily build
SQL-Statements and execute them.
