 <s>An implementation of Integrated Templates API with template 'compilation' added</s>
 <d>HTML_Template_Sigma implements Integrated Templates API designed by Ulf Wendel.

Features:
* Nested blocks. Nesting is controlled by the engine.
* Ability to include files from within template: &lt;!-- INCLUDE --&gt;
* Automatic removal of empty blocks and unknown variables (methods to manually tweak/override this are also available)
* Methods for runtime addition and replacement of blocks in templates
* Ability to insert simple function calls into templates: func_uppercase('Hello world!') and to define callback functions for these
* 'Compiled' templates: the engine has to parse a template file using regular expressions to find all the blocks and variable placeholders. This is a very &quot;expensive&quot; operation and is an overkill to do on every page request: templates seldom change on production websites. Thus this feature: an internal representation of the template structure is saved into a file and this file gets loaded instead of the source one on subsequent requests (unless the source changes)
* PHPUnit-based tests to define correct behaviour
* Usage examples for most of the features are available, look in the docs/ directory</d>

 <n>Changed unit tests to use current PHPUnit from http://www.phpunit.de/ rather
than old unsupported one from http://pear.php.net/

Implemented parts of request #12221 (thanks to Carsten Wiedmann for ideas and 
their initial implementation)
 * It is now possible to add comments to the template file that are removed 
   from output: &lt;!-- COMMENT --&gt; ... &lt;!-- /COMMENT --&gt;
 * Added new builtin callbacks 'e' and 'r' for htmlentities() and 
   rawurlencode(), respectively
 * Added the 'charset' option for builtin 'h' and 'e' callbacks</n>
