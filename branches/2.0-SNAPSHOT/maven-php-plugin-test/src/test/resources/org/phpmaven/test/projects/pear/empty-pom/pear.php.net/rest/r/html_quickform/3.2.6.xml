 <n>Development of QuickForm version 3 is now frozen. Only bug fixing will be
done. All feature requests should be submitted for HTML_QuickForm2 package.

Bugfixes:
* Typo in javascript generated for form validation (bug #5205)
* Default values for single-selects were ignored if form was considered
  submitted (bug #5269)
* Fixed array-based options for HTML_QuickForm_date (bug #5364)
* Javascript validation of single radiobutton failed (bug #5644)
* Incorrect fetch mode used in HTML_QuickForm_select::loadDbResult()
  (bug #5705)
* Removed unused variables found by code analysis (bug #5920)
* hierselect now works correctly with HTML entities in option texts,
  fix idea borrowed from Prototype JS library (bug #5974)
* advcheckbox failed to submit properly if its id attribute was set equal 
  to its name, due to javascript problems (bug #6134)
* HTML_QuickForm_hierselect::setValue() should not decrease the number of
  select elements in hierselect (bug #6766)
* HTML_QuickForm::isTypeRegistered() is now case-insensitive (bug #7342)
* Form is considered not valid after explicitly adding error via
  HTML_QuickForm::setElementError() (bug #7470)
* Regexps for 'error' and 'required' blocks in Default renderer now match
  ungreedy, this allows having several such blocks in a template (bug #7820)
* Document the return value of HTML_QuickForm_file::moveUploadedFile()
  (bug #7832)

Additions and changes:
* Traditional Chinese translation for date element (request #5165)
* Brazilian Portuguese translation for date element (request #5541)
* An error message for element is now removed if removing the element via
  HTML_QuickForm::removeElement(..., true) or passing an empty argument to
  HTML_QuickForm::setElementError().
* advcheckbox element no longer uses any javascript, therefore its JS-related
  methods getOnclickJS() and getPrivateName() are no longer used internally
  and are deprecated.</n>
