 <s>User authentication and permission management framework</s>
 <d>LiveUser is a set of classes for dealing with user authentication
  and permission management. Basically, there are three main elements that
  make up this package:

  * The LiveUser class
  * The Auth containers
  * The Perm containers

  The LiveUser class takes care of the login process and can be configured
  to use a certain permission container and one or more different auth containers.
  That means, you can have your users' data scattered amongst many data containers
  and have the LiveUser class try each defined container until the user is found.
  For example, you can have all website users who can apply for a new account online
  on the webserver's local database. Also, you want to enable all your company's
  employees to login to the site without the need to create new accounts for all of
  them. To achieve that, a second container can be defined to be used by the LiveUser class.

  You can also define a permission container of your choice that will manage the rights for
  each user. Depending on the container, you can implement any kind of permission schemes
  for your application while having one consistent API.

  Using different permission and auth containers, it's easily possible to integrate
  newly written applications with older ones that have their own ways of storing permissions
  and user data. Just make a new container type and you're ready to go!

  Currently available are containers using:
  PEAR::DB, PEAR::MDB, PEAR::MDB2, PECL::PDO, PEAR::XML_Tree, PEAR::Auth, Session.

- changed API for readuserData(), auth_user_id parameter now contains the
  auth_user_id to use
- login() now supports passing in an auth_user_id instead of the handle/password
- made stack property public
- typo fix in PDO container readImplyingRights() method (bug #7195)
- expanded error handling in Log instance creation
- handle if no proper credentials where passed to readUserData() (bug #7262)
- replace isset() with array_key_exists() where applicable
- disable __autoload() in class_exists() calls (bug #7304)
- brought property names in line s/rights/right_ids *BC break*
- MDB2_Schema 0.5 and MDB2 2.0.1 handles nulls in schema files properly so
  there is no need to disable MDB2_PORTABILITY_EMPTY_TO_NULL in the installer</n>
