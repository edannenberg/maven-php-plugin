 <s>Internationalization</s>
 <d>This package provides basic support to localize your application, like locale based formatting of dates, numbers and currency.  Beside that it attempts to provide an OS independent way to setlocale() and aims to provide language and country names translated into many languages.

PUBLIC REQUEST
--------------
As I'm not able to dig through all locales of the world, any contribution of locale dependent information is very wellcome!

There's very need of people contributing:
 * locale dependent date/time formatting conventions
 * translations and reviews of country names (I18Nv2_Country)
 * translations and reviews of language names (I18Nv2_Language)
Just browse the CVS sources at http://cvs.php.net/cvs.php/pear/I18Nv2 and see if your language or locale is already fully covered.
