 <n>MAJOR SECURITY FIXES

Prior versions of this package had major
vulnerabilities when using the add*() methods to
build your forms.

This release resolves all of the security issues
and fixes some unreported bugs.  In addition, the
documentation block comment for the display()
method now accurately reflects how it works.</n>
