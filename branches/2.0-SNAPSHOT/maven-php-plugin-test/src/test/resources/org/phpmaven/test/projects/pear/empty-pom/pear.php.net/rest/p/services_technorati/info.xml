 <s>A class for interacting with the Technorati API</s>
 <d>Services_Technorati is a wrapper for the REST-based Technorati webservices API. Technorati is a blog search engine that provides a number of interfaces for interacting with recent blog entries, such as searching for entries that link to a certain URL, are linked from a certain URL, or have been given certain tags.

Services_Technorati provides an interface to all of the query types in Technorati API version 1.0, and supports filesystem caching of query data using Cache_Lite compatible cache objects.

As of version 0.7.0 this package is PHP5 only, and requires simplexml.</d>
