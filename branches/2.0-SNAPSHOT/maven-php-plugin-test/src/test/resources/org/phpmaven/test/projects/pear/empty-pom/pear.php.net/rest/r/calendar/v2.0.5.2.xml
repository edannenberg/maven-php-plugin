 <s>A package for building Calendar data structures (irrespective of output)</s>
 <d>Calendar provides an API for building Calendar data structures. Using
the simple iterator and it's &quot;query&quot; API, a user interface can easily be
built on top of the calendar data structure, at the same time easily connecting it
to some kind of underlying data store, where &quot;event&quot; information is
being held.

It provides different calculation &quot;engines&quot; the default being based on
Unix timestamps (offering fastest performance) with an alternative using PEAR::Date
which extends the calendar past the limitations of Unix timestamps. Other engines
should be implementable for other types of calendar (e.g. a Chinese Calendar based
on lunar cycles).

 <n>* Small refactoring in the date engines to significantly reduce the number
  of date() calls
* make url default separator xhtml compliant
* fix bug #1798 with week selection
* fix bug #1995: thisWeek, prevWeek, nextWeek were not affected when a new
  timestamp was set (thanks to johnschaefer at gmx dot de)
* fix bug in return value from Calendar_Week::thisWeek and n_in_month
* getMinYears() returned 1970 on all platforms (thanks to Andy Crain)
* added some new examples
* Moved logic from Calendar_Decorator_Uri and Calendar_Decorator_Textual to
   Calendar_Util_Uri and Calendar_Util_Textual (BC preserved) - offers better
   performance, reducing number of decorators required
* extended engine interface for week related methods to meet rare use cases with
   (not yet implemented) calendar engines</n>
