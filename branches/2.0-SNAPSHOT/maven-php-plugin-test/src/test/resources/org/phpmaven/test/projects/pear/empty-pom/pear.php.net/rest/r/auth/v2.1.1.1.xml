 <s>Creating an authentication system.</s>
 <d>The PEAR::Auth package provides methods for creating an authentication
system using PHP.

Currently it supports the following storage containers to read/write
the login data:

* All databases supported by the PEAR database layer
* Plaintext files
* LDAP servers
</d>
 <da>2002-10-04 20:10:00</da>
 <n>* This release fixes a bug that caused some files of PEAR::Auth to be
  installed in wrong places. Everyone who has installed version 1.1.0
  is urged to update to this version!

Following is a list of changes in version 1.1.0. We are including this
list here because the changelog entries were not displayed properly in
the previous release:

* Silenced some warnings when working with &quot;error_reporting(E_ALL);&quot;
  and fixed two bugs.

* Don't update idletime after the authentification session has expired.

* Allow setting session ID in assignData(). This becomes handy when
  using Auth_HTTP. (Patch by Marko Karppinen, &lt;karppinen@pobox.com&gt;)

* Added optional setLoginCallback() and setLogoutCallback() methods.
  (Patch by Marko Karppinen, &lt;karppinen@pobox.com&gt;)

* Added method setIdle() that complements to setExpire().
  (Patch by Marko Karppinen, &lt;karppinen@pobox.com&gt;)

* Added new methods setAuthData() and getAuthData() that allow to write
  and read additional data into/from the session pool.

* Improved internal handling of session variables.

* Instead of sticking to md5 as the password encryption method, one
  can now choose between standard Unix DES-based encryption algorithm,
  md5 hashing and using plain text passwords. Please note that the
  last option is a security risk and shouldn't be used unless you
  *really* now what you are doing.
  
* Database storage container: Only open connection to SQL server if it
  is really necessary. This speeds up the whole process in a lot of
  situations.</n>
