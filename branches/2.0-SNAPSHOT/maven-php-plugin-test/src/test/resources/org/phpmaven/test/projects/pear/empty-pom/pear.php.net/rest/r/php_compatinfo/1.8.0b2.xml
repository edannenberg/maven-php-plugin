Thanks to John Parise and Ken Guest, for their agreement to reuse code and idea
from their packages. Idea about connecting a driver (see PEAR_Size) and
how to build/check an instance of a custom renderer (see Log) if class
is available loaded somewhere.

* news
API 1.8.0 since beta 2 was almost full rewrite following the MVC design pattern.
This version, that DO NOT break Backward Compatibility, introduces at least two big
features :
1. Event-Driven capability (see PEAR::Event_Dispatcher),
2. Customizable and extendable Renderers

Do not forget to have a look on 3 news examples pci180_parse* that demonstrates
the new API.

Beta 2 include 3 renderers :
- &quot;Null&quot; that consumes all output. Usefull for batch mode
- &quot;Array&quot; the default. That dump results as a PHP array (like previous versions)
  but allow also to print improved array with help of PEAR::Var_Dump if available.
- &quot;Xml&quot; that produces XML results with PEAR::XML_Util and improve its render
  with PEAR::XML_Beautifier if available.

  WARNING: if you use benefit of XML_Beautifier with the Xml renderer and see
            the XML prolog/declaration be removed, DO NOT add a new bug report
            it is the old Bug #5450 !

Beta 3 that will come shortly will include 2 new more renderers :
- Html, for web page content
- Text, for command line interface (that will come back again live)

* QA
- Do no search Unit tests in this release, it is not yet ready, so I have removed
  them until beta3</n>
