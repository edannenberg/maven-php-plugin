 <s>Render a data table with automatic pagination and sorting</s>
 <d>This package provides a toolkit to generate data tables in HTML, CSV,
 Excel, XML, Smarty, and other formats.  
 It retrieves data from a variety of data sources, including SQL, CSV,
 XML, PDO, DB_DataObject, DB_Table, and others.
 It can transparently page and sort the data, through optimized database
 queries, by parsing/generating GET, POST requests and REST-like urls.
 It is designed with modularity and extensibility in mind, using drivers
 for all rendering and datasource formats.</d>
 <da>2007-12-18 11:16:41</da>
 <n>- add 18 examples, including simple AJAX support
- support setting rendering options for all renderers at once
  with setRendererOption*()
- new common renderer options: onMove and onMoveData, for support of
  onclick/onsubmit events
- rename 'primary_key' DataSource option as 'primaryKey'
- new PDO DataSource driver is available as a separate subpackage
- new URL mapping feature by Sascha Grossenbacher,
- Request #9994 :new setUrlFormat() method providing clean URL mapping,
  by Sascha Grossenbacher
- add ability to use objects of any class instead of associative arrays as 
  records (not all datasources support that, and renderers handle such objects
  differently whether they support &quot;Object Preserving&quot; or not)
- add Smarty renderer unit test</n>
