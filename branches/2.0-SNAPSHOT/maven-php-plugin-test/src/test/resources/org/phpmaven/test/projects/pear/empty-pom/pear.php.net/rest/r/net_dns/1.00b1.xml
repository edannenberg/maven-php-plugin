 <s>Resolver library used to communicate with a DNS server</s>
 <d>A resolver library used to communicate with a name server to perform DNS queries, zone transfers, dynamic DNS updates, etc.  Creates an object hierarchy from a DNS server's response, which allows you to view all of the information given by the DNS server.  It bypasses the system's resolver library and communicates directly with the server.

 <n>- Tested with PHP 4.3.0
- Should have no warnings under with maximum error_reporting setting 
- Fixed bug: did not understand name server responses using the one-answer zone transfer format
- Fixed more problems with PHP warning about uninitialized variables

Note that the interface to the axfr function has changed.  Software relying on the old (buggy) style of axfr queries will need to be updated to call axfr_old() instead of axfr().  The new axfr() function will not return a DNS packet, but an array of RRs ONLY.</n>
