 <s>Xpath/DOM XML manipulation, maneuvering and query interface.</s>
 <d>Allows for easy manipulation, maneuvering and querying of a domxml tree using
      both xpath queries and DOM walk functions.  It uses an internal pointer for all
      methods on which the action is performed.  Results from an xpath query are returned
      as an XPath_Result object, which contains all the DOM functions from the main object.
      This class tries to hold as close as possible to the DOM Recommendation.

      The XML_XPath class was inpired by a class maintained by Nigel Swinson called phpxpath.
      The phpxpath class does not rely on PHP xmldom functions and is therefore a sibling to
      this class: http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpxpath
