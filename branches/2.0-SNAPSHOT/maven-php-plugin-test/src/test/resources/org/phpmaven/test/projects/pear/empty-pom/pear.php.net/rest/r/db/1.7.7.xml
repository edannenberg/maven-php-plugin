 <s>Database Abstraction Layer</s>
 <d>DB is a database abstraction layer providing:
* an OO-style query API
* portability features that make programs written for one DBMS work with other DBMS's
* a DSN (data source name) format for specifying database servers
* prepare/execute (bind) emulation for databases that don't support it natively
* a result object for each query response
* portable error codes
* sequence emulation
* sequential and non-sequential row fetching as well as bulk fetching
* formats fetched rows as associative arrays, ordered arrays or objects
* row limit support
* transactions support
* table information interface
* DocBook and phpDocumentor API documentation

DB layers itself on top of PHP's existing
database extensions.

Drivers for the following extensions pass
the complete test suite and provide
interchangeability when all of DB's
portability options are enabled:

  fbsql, ibase, informix, msql, mssql,
  mysql, mysqli, oci8, odbc, pgsql,
  sqlite and sybase.

There is also a driver for the dbase
extension, but it can't be used
interchangeably because dbase doesn't
support many standard DBMS features.

DB is compatible with both PHP 4 and PHP 5.

 <n>This release of DB fixes numerous minor bugs and improves compatibility with
PHP 5.2 for the msql, sqlite and sybase drivers.

DB:
* added ability to specify port number when using unix sockets in DB::parseDSN()
  Bug 5982

* Tweak quoteSmart() to allows MS Access to wrap dates
  in #'s.  Bug 4813.

dbase:
* Added DB_dbase::freeResult().  Bug 6967.

ifx:
* Added support for error codes as at Informix 10.

msql:
* Fix error mapping in PHP 5.2.  Bug 9599.

mssql:
* Use mssql_fetch_assoc() instead of mssql_fetch_array().
  Should resolve FreeTDS and/or Sybase issues discussed
  in bug 1525, et al.
* Fix issues with delimited identifiers in mssql tableInfo().
  Bug 8336.
* Added support for some of the key error codes introduced in SQL Server 2005.

mysql:
* fixed handling of fully qualified table names in tableInfo().  Bug 4272.
* Added support for new error codes in MySQL 5.

mysqli:
* worked around an issue in 'len' handling of tableInfo(). There is a bug in
  ext/mysqli or the mysqli docs.  Bug 5680.
* Added support for new error codes in MySQL 5.

oci8:
* Allowed old-style functions to use the database DSN field if hostspec isn't
  provided. Thanks to David Palm for the fix.  Bug 7501.

pgsql:
* When inserting to non-existant column, produce
  proper error, &quot;no such field&quot;, instead of
  &quot;no such table&quot;.  Bug 4365.

* If connection is lost, raise DB_ERROR_CONNECT_FAILED
  instead of the generic DB_ERROR.  Bug 4446.

* Allow FETCH queries to return results.  Bug 4112.

sqlite:
* Fix bug sqlite:///:memory: trys to open file.  Bug 6599.
* Fix error mapping in PHP 5.2.  Bug 9599.

sybase:
* Allow connecting without specifying db name.  Bug 4588.
* Fix error mapping in PHP 5.2.  Bug 9599.
