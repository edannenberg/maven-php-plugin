 <s>An SQL Builder, Object Interface to Database Tables</s>
 <d>DataObject performs 2 tasks:
  1. Builds SQL statements based on the objects vars and the builder methods.
  2. acts as a datastore for a table row.
  The core class is designed to be extended for each of your tables so that you put the
  data logic inside the data classes.
  included is a Generator to make your configuration files and your base classes.

 <n>New Features / Fixes
* proxy and auto schema building
  - you can use dataobjects wihout running create tables.
  - schema is created on the fly if no schema file exists
  - using config option proxy=full, a class is generated on the fly to
    represent the tables.
* toValue and fromValue added as getter and setter providers
  - they include date formating tools - eg.
  $do-&gt;getBirthDay('%d/%m/%Y') will work with overload and PEAR::Date 
  to provide formated dates. (works with date/time and datetime)
  - set*() will also call strtotime and PEAR::Date to try and read dates.\
  setFrom will relay into fromValue() - hence auto fixing date entries
* make native key recognision a little better - changes ini file
  format (key=N|K) - native or key. - BC protected... - ignores it
  when it finds a number.. (Fixes bug #532)
* allow multiple updates on the same object - without adding lots
  of id=.... on the end..
* transactions support works transparently by sending
  $do-&gt;query('BEGIN'), $do-&gt;query('COMMIT'),$do-&gt;query('ROLLBACK')
  will automatically relay into the DB methods.
* re-add support for sequence_{tablename} - prefered method is still
  overriding sequenceKey, and returning correct values.

Bug Fixes
* fix bug #595 - replace non letters in class names with underscore..
* fix bug #532 - better recoginsion of sequence keys
* fix bug #528/#476 - typo fix (E_NOTICE error on $valu)
* fix bug #473 - query can return a DB_Error 
* fix bug #501 - autoload/factory  now uses full path (not require path)
* fix bug #507 - sequences broken</n>
