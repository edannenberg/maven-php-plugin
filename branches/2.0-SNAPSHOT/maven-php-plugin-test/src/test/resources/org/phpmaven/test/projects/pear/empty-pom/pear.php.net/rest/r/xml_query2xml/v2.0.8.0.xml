 <s>Creates XML data from SQL queries</s>
 <d>XML_Query2XML allows you to transform the records retrieved
with one or more SQL SELECT queries into XML data. Very simple to
highly complex transformations are supported. Is was written with
performance in mind and can handle large amounts of data. No XSLT needed!
Major features:
1. XML_Query2XML works with the classes provided by PHP5's DOM XML extension
2. minimum effort necessary to get the simple jobs done
3. highly configurable for more complex tasks
4. ISO/IEC 9075-14:2005 support: mapping of SQL identifiers to XML names
5. works with any database that is supported by PEAR DB, PEAR MDB2 or ADOdb
6. debugging and logging features
7. provides profiling features
8. in-depth documentation: tutorials and API documentation
9. Eight case studies: from very simple to highly complex scenarios
10. 433 phpt unit tests</d>

 <n>This release is *NOT BACKWARD COMPATIBLE*.
I'm sorry for the BC break, but due to security considerations XML_Query2XML
does not use the native function eval() anymore. Therefore
- the &quot;!&quot; prefix is not supported anymore
- the behaviour of the &quot;condition&quot; option was changed
- the new callback prefix &quot;#&quot; was added (use it instead of the &quot;!&quot; prefix)

A migration strategy is documented at
http://query2xml.sf.net/docs/html/XML_Query2XML/tutorial_XML_Query2XML.pkg.html#migration

Also:
- unit tests were migrated from PHPUnit2 to phpt
- XML_Query2XML now comes with 433 unit tests
- migrated from package.xml version 1.0 to version 2.0</n>
