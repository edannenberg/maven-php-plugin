 <s>A tabular structure that contains a record set of data for paging and sorting purposes.</s>
 <d>This package offers a toolkit to render out a datagrid in HTML format as well as
many other formats such as an XML Document, an Excel Spreadsheet, an XUL Document and more.
It also offers paging and sorting functionallity to limit the data that is presented and processed.
This concept is based on the .NET Framework DataGrid control and works very well with database and XML result sets.</d>

 <n>- added streaming support for outputting large datasets that can exceed PHP's
  memory limit; streaming is currently supported by many DataSource drivers and
  the CSV and XML renderers; more details about this new feature can be found
  in the manual
- secured the sort direction input string
- new abstract writeMode DataSource interface, for future support of data
  editing features
- new SDG_Column::format() method providing auto-formatters for dates, numbers
  and more
- bug #9566: new Structures_DataGrid::getColumns() method for fetching all
  of the columns currently loaded in the datagrid
  (thanks to Daniel Garcia, daniel at assertio dot es)
- bug #9548: new SDG_Column::set|getDefaultDirection() methods for 
  handling per-column default sorting directions
  (thanks to Anton, hire at ukr dot net)
- bug #7710: new generateColumns() method. The DataSource options 
  &quot;generate_columns&quot; and &quot;labels&quot; are now deprecated.
- BC break: renderer auto-detection for HTML_QuickForm objects was removed
  because there will be more renderers that accept HTML_QuickForm objects in
  the future
  (to make your code work again, you just need to specify 'HTMLSortForm' as the
  renderer on render(), getOutput(), fill() etc. calls)
