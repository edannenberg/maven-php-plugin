 <s>database abstraction layer</s>
 <d>Documentation can be found at: http://www.backendmedia.com/MDB/docs/

    PEAR MDB is a merge of the PEAR DB and Metabase php database abstraction layers.

    It provides a common API for all support RDBMS. The main difference to most other DB abstraction packages is that MDB goes much further to ensure portability. Among other things MDB features:
    * An OO-style query API
    * A DSN (data source name) or array format for specifying database servers
    * Datatype abstraction and on demand datatype conversion
    * Portable error codes
    * Sequential and non sequential row fetching as well as bulk fetching
    * Ordered array and associative array for the fetched rows
    * Prepare/execute (bind) emulation
    * Sequence emulation
    * Replace emulation
    * Limited Subselect emulation
    * Row limit support
    * Transactions support
    * Large Object support
    * Index/Unique support
    * Module Framework to load advanced functionality on demand
    * Table information interface
    * RDBMS management methods (creating, dropping, altering)
    * RDBMS independent xml based schema definition management
    * Altering of a DB from a changed xml schema
    * Reverse engineering of xml schemas from an existing DB (currently only MySQL)
    * Full integration into the PEAR Framework
    * Wrappers for the PEAR DB and Metabase APIs
    * PHPDoc API documentation

    Currently supported RDBMS:
    MySQL
    PostGreSQL
    Oracle
    Frontbase
    Querysim
    Interbase
    Firebird
    Other soon to follow.

 <da>2003-04-23 21:33:00</da>
 <n>- This is mainly a bug fix release
- 4 new driver were added
    Oracle (still Beta)
    Frontbase (still Alpha)
    Interbase/Firebird (still Alpha, due to missing features)
    Querysim
- All get*Value() methods (excet get*lobValue() for now) will convert a php NULL into an SQL NULL
  (resulting in API changes in the NULL handling of the get*Value() and replace() methods)
- REPLACE emulation now works more similar to how MySQLs REPLACE works
- Moved code from the Common constructor into MDB::connect()
- Moved code from the Driver constructor into the drivers connect method
- PostGreSQL reverse engineering partly implemented
- Made the MDB_Date classe behave more similar to PEAR::Date (especially in regards to daylight saving time)</n>
