 <s>PHP5 Resolver library used to communicate with a DNS server.</s>
 <d>Provides (roughly) the same functionality as Net_DNS, but using PHP5 objects, exceptions for error handling, better sockets support.

This release is (in most cases) 2x - 10x faster than Net_DNS, as well as includes more RR's (including DNSSEC RR's), and improved sockets and streams support.</d>

 <n>- fixed a bug in the Net_DNS2_Updater class; I wasn't resetting the internal packet request values, so in some cases making more than one request on the same instance would fail.
- Fixed a bug in Net_DNS2; I wasn't handling comments properly when parsing the resolv.conf file.
- check for duplicate entries when adding/deleting entries in the Updater() class; BIND will throw and error if you try to delete the same RR twice in the same request, not sure if this is expected behaviour
- modified several RR's to clean up the trailing period when it's displayed on hosts.</n>
