 <s>PEAR Base System</s>
 <d>The PEAR package contains:
 * the PEAR base class
 * the PEAR_Error error handling mechanism
 * the PEAR installer, for creating, distributing
   and installing packages
</d>
 <da>2003-05-10 23:27:00</da>
 <n>PEAR BASE CLASS:

* PEAR_Error now supports exceptions when using Zend Engine 2.  Set the
  error mode to PEAR_ERROR_EXCEPTION to make PEAR_Error throw itself
  as an exception (invoke PEAR errors with raiseError() or throwError()
  just like before).

PEAR INSTALLER:

* Packaging and validation now parses PHP source code (unless
  ext/tokenizer is disabled) and does some coding standard conformance
  checks.  Specifically, the names of classes and functions are
  checked to ensure that they are prefixed with the package name.  If
  your package has symbols that should be without this prefix, you can
  override this warning by explicitly adding a &quot;provides&quot; entry in
  your package.xml file.  See the package.xml file for this release
  for an example (OS_Guess, System and md5_file).

  All classes and non-private (not underscore-prefixed) methods and
  functions are now registered during &quot;pear package&quot;.</n>
