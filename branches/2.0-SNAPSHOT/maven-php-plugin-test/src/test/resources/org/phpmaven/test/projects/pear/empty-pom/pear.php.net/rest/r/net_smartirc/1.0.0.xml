 <s>Net_SmartIRC is a PHP class for communication with IRC networks</s>
 <d>Net_SmartIRC is a PHP class for communication with IRC networks,

  (it contains following info: from, nick, ident, host, channel, message, type, rawmessage)
- actionhandler for the API
  on different types of messages (channel/notice/query/kick/join..) callbacks can be registered

 <n>v1.0.0:
-------
Released as 1.0.0 because current PEAR rule require this for stable
packages, there are _no_ big changes in this release!

fixes:
 - renamed Net_SmartIRC_base::Net_SmartIRC to
   Net_SmartIRC_base::Net_SmartIRC_base
   a PHP4 bug made it work, in PHP5 its fixed and doesn't
   (closes PEAR bug #1466, sf.net patch #967067)
 - fixed a bug in _rawreceive()
   the parser checked if he found a colon (messagepart) but +1 was added, the
   check never worked right (I found this bug while porting SmartIRC to C#)
 - fixed bug in _gettype()
   the regexs was too sloppy, sometimes it got confused, this can break easily
   the ChannelSync code.
 - fixed bug in _event_rpl_whoreply()
   on some IRC networks, the channel info in who replies can't be used, they
   return sometimes random channels, this can break ChannelSync code.
 - fixed include paths in example scripts (closes PEAR bug #2042)

changes:
 - applied load socket extension patch (sf.net patch #911993) from
   Anatoly Techtonik &lt;techtonik@users.sourceforge.net&gt;
   if the socket extension is not loaded, it will now try to load it for *nix
   and windows.

new:
 - added objListenFor() method
   it works like listenFor() but returns an array of the received ircdata
   objects (not just ircdata-&gt;message like listenFor() does)</n>
