 <s>make-rpm-spec command for managing RPM .spec files for PEAR packages</s>
 <d>This command is an improved implementation of the standard 'makerpm' command,
  and contains several enhancements that make it far more flexible. Similar 
  functions for other external packaging mechanisms may be added at a later date.

  Enhanced features over the original PEAR &quot;makerpm&quot; command include:
  
  - Ability to define a release on the command line
  - Allows more advanced customisation of the generated package name
  - Allows virtual Provides/Requires that differ in format from the package name
    format 
  - tries to intelligently distinguish between PEAR and PECL when generating 
    packages</d>

 <n>- fix Bug #9932: cannot build specs from external channels [cellog]
- fix Bug #10116: fatal error when packaging packages from other channel [cellog]
- NEW: Can now build specs for channels as well as packages
- Can now build specs for packages from channels other than pear.php.net (bug #9932, bug #10116, bug #10254)
- @possible_channel@ now doesn't include a trailing slash (template.spec changed to accommodate)
- @possible_channel@ is now filled even if channel is pecl.php.net/pear.php.net - this is part of moving towards a less pear.php.net-centric system where the core PEAR channels are not particularly &quot;special&quot;
- Add the following macros:
 - @php_files_statement@
 - @test_files_statement@
 - @data_files_statement@
 - @script_files_statement@
 - @customrole_files_statement@
 - @cfg_files_statement@
 - @www_files_statement@
 All of these are &quot;intelligent&quot; in that they are empty if no files of the given type exist, plus if files do exist and are in a subdirectory dedicated to the package being RPM-ified, then make-rpm-spec will just put the top level directory in the substitution, rather than a complete file list - this makes for much shorter specs in some cases. Use of the @XXX_files_statement@ substitutions is encouraged in favour of the @files@ substitution.
- Deprecate @rpm_xml_dir@ macro - this is pointless (replaced with actual path in the template specs)
- Deprecate @arch@ macro - this gave invalid results; it should either be &quot;noarch&quot; or not defined, not the architecture of the machine building the spec file. Replaced by @arch_statement@ if you really want to use it, although the building of specs for compiled packages (i.e. PECL) is not supported at the moment, even though in theory it should work in a similar way.
- Fix a bug if PEAR/PackageFile.php was already included
- Fix bug #10327, bug #8630 - file prefixes sometimes generated incorrectly, stops some packages building
- Add $_spec_line_format config option to allow distributors to tune the format that additional RPM headers are added to the spec in, to match their conventions
- Internal refactoring/cleanup
- Require PHP 4.3.0+ to avoid internal cruft
- Tidy summaries (trim and remove trailing dots)</n>
