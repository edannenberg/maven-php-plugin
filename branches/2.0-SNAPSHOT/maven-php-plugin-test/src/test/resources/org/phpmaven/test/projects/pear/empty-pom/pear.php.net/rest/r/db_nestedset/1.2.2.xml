 <s>API to build and query nested sets</s>
 <d>DB_NestedSet let's you create trees with infinite depth
inside a relational database.
The package provides a way to
o create/update/delete nodes
o query nodes, trees and subtrees
o copy (clone) nodes, trees and subtrees
o move nodes, trees and subtrees
o call event handlers on specific events like
  on node deletion
o output the tree with 
  - PEAR::HTML_TreeMenu
  - TigraMenu (http://www.softcomplex.com/products/tigra_menu/)
o It also features caching of SQL queries using PEAR::Cache
