 <s>Package to read, create or modify office documents in open document format.</s>
 <d>OpenDocument is a package to read, create or modify office documents in open document format.
OpenDocument format is a replacement for proprietary office formats such as .doc or .xls. This package is a very useful tool for php developers and another point to switch from proprietary office formats to OpenDocument one, that means switching to open source software and standards.
OpenDocument was developed as a project of Google Summer of Code 2006 Program.
Package provides object oriented style for working with open documents, a little similar to DOM as for XML.</d>
