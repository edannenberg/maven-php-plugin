 <s>An SQL Builder, Object Interface to Database Tables</s>
 <d>DataObject performs 2 tasks:
  1. Builds SQL statements based on the objects vars and the builder methods.
  2. acts as a datastore for a table row.
  The core class is designed to be extended for each of your tables so that you put the
  data logic inside the data classes.
  included is a Generator to make your configuration files and your base classes.</d>

 <n>Modular Release version.

This version was designed to support multiple locations of DataObjects for use with
modular applications. - NOTE the change to ini_DATABASENAME may fixes the previous behaviour to 
match the documented behaviour - however this may break existing installations.

New Features:
#-------  class_location accepts multiple locations with PATH_SEPARATOR 
#-------  class_prefix accepts multiple prefixes with PATH_SEPARATOR 
#-------  ini_DATABASENAME merges all found ini files in paths (seperated by PATH_SEPARATOR)
            previous behaviour was just to read the first. - this applies to matching links.ini files.
#12550 -  disable_null_strings=full -- see the bug report for details - it is highly recommended not to use this feature,
          as it may result in data being deleted from your database if not used carefully.

Notes:
#-------  staticGet now marked depreciated.
#-------  links_DATABASENAME does not support multiple paths
#-------  staticAutoloadTable (depreciated) and staticGet (depreciated) do not support this feature</n>
