 <s>Unicode Normalizer</s>
 <d>&quot;...Unicode's normalization is the concept of character composition and decomposition.
Character composition is the process of combining simpler characters into fewer precomposed characters, such as the n character and the combining ~ character into the single n+~ character. Decomposition is the opposite process, breaking precomposed characters back into their component pieces...
...Normalization is important when comparing text strings for searching and sorting (collation)...&quot; [Wikipedia] 
Performs the 4 normalizations:
NFD:  Canonical Decomposition NFC:  Canonical Decomposition, followed by Canonical Composition NFKD: Compatibility Decomposition NFKC: Compatibility Decomposition, followed by Canonical Composition Complies with the official Unicode.org regression test.
Uses UTF8 binary strings natively but can normalize a string in any UTF format.
Fully tested with phpUnit. Code coverage test close to 100%.</d>
