 <s>make-rpm-spec command for managing RPM .spec files for PEAR packages</s>
 <d>This command is an improved implementation of the standard makerpm command,
  and contains several enhancements that make it far more flexible. Similar 
  functions for other external packaging mechanisms may be added at a later date.

  Enhanced features over the original PEAR &quot;makerpm&quot; command include:
  
  - Ability to define a release on the command line
  - Allows more advanced customisation of the generated package name
  - Allows virtual Provides/Requires that differ in format from the package name
    format 
  - tries to intelligently distinguish between PEAR and PECL when generating 
    packages</d>
 <da>2006-05-17 17:36:38</da>
 <n>- Add support for generation of external deps (e.g. PHP extensions) (bug #6971)
- Add %l (lowercased package name) option to RPM pkgname/depname format strings
- Add support for customising the output specfile filename via the $_rpm_specname_format variable
- Make it super-easy for downstream distros to customise the various package/dep/specfile naming to suit their conventions: all the options are now grouped together in the source
- Add release_state macro for use in spec templates if required
- De-duplicate dependencies (bug #6963)
- Remove a last remaining case of hardcoded &quot;PEAR::&quot; package naming (when generating deps on PEAR itself)
- Improve/tidy up docfile handling (bug #7118)
- Revert PEAR package dependency to 1.4.3 and encode the 1.4.7 dep in the included template.spec instead.
- Remove some forced 'rm's in template spec file to avoid masking problems
- Abstract XML directory in default template spec
- Stop owning / in RPM packages (bug #7129)
- Wordwrap package description</n>
