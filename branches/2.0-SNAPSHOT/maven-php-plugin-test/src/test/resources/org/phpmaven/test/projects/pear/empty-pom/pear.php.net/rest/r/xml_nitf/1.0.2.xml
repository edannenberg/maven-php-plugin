 <s>Parse NITF documents.</s>
 <d>This package provides a NITF XML parser. The parser was designed with NITF version 3.1, but should be forward-compatible when new versions of the NITF DTD are produced. Various methods for accessing the major elements of the document, such as the hedline(s), byline, and lede are provided. This class was originally tested against the Associated Press's (AP) XML data feed.

reformatted so that spacing is all tabs.</n>
