 <s>The phpDocumentor package provides automatic documenting of php api directly from the source.</s>
 <d>The phpDocumentor tool is a standalone auto-documentor similar to JavaDoc
written in PHP.  It differs from PHPDoc in that it is MUCH faster, parses a much
wider range of php files, and comes with many customizations including 11 HTML
templates, windows help file CHM output, PDF output, and XML DocBook peardoc2
output for use with documenting PEAR.  In addition, it can do PHPXref source
code highlighting and linking.

Features (short list):
-output in HTML, PDF (directly), CHM (with windows help compiler), XML DocBook
-very fast
-web and command-line interface
-fully customizable output with Smarty-based templates
-recognizes JavaDoc-style documentation with special tags customized for PHP 4
-automatic linking, class inheritance diagrams and intelligent override
-customizable source code highlighting, with phpxref-style cross-referencing
-parses standard README/CHANGELOG/INSTALL/FAQ files and includes them
 directly in documentation
-generates a todo list from @todo tags in source
-generates multiple documentation sets based on @access private, @internal and
 {@internal} tags
-example php files can be placed directly in documentation with highlighting
 and phpxref linking using the @example tag
-linking between external manual and API documentation is possible at the
 sub-section level in all output formats
-easily extended for specific documentation needs with Converter
-full documentation of every feature, manual can be generated directly from
 the source code with &quot;phpdoc -c makedocs&quot; in any format desired.
-current manual always available at http://www.phpdoc.org/manual.php
-user .ini files can be used to control output, multiple outputs can be
 generated at once

- Many improvements to in-code API documentation including new
  tags, and better handling of in-code html tags
- CHM and PDF converters are both beta quality
- New XML:DocBook/peardoc converter makes generating PEAR
  manual formats easy for PEAR developers along with the --pear command-line switch
- Many new HTML templates, all of them beautiful thanks to Marco von Ballmoos

***********************************************************************
phpDocumentor != PHPDoc
Do not use &quot;pear install PHPDoc&quot; if you want phpDocumentor, use
&quot;pear install PhpDocumentor&quot; the two tools are completely separate.
***********************************************************************

for PEAR users, the new --pear command-line switch will be a boon.  Leave it on
by default if your package follows PEAR coding and directory naming standards

The peardoc2 converter has been moved to an extension of the DocBook converter,
to use, the command-line has changed from XML:DocBook:peardoc2 to
XML:DocBook/peardoc2:default.

We have removed the HTML:default converter entirely, use HTML:frames.  This
will fix the last of the persistent windows installation bugs.</n>
