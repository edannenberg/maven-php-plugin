 <d>Parsing BibTex data to an array and converting an array to BibTex Data and export it to various formats.</d>
 <da>2006-12-05 14:42:31</da>
 <n>* Validation now includes checking the type of the entry
* Added possibility to remove curly braces in value
* Now a warning is generated when the closing brace of an entry is missing. And it is now parsed correctly.
* Bug Hunting: When the value of the author entry had a newline it was parsed wrong. This is now fixed by unwrapping the author fields prior to extracting the authors.
* Bug hunting: now also a warning is generated when the very last entry has a missing closing brace
* The output of the Author can now be set via the authorstring
This should be the final release before the stable 1.0 release.</n>
