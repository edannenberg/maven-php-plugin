 <s>PHP5 Resolver library used to communicate with a DNS server.</s>
 <d>Provides (roughly) the same functionality as Net_DNS, but using PHP5 objects, exceptions for error handling, better sockets support.

This release is (in most cases) 2x - 10x faster than Net_DNS, as well as includes more RR's (including DNSSEC RR's), and improved sockets and streams support.</d>

 <n>- added numeric error codes to the Lookups class, and had each method that throws an exception throw a numeric error code along with the message.
- dropped all references to InvalidArgumentException; we only use the Net_DNS2_Exception from now on.
- added the CAA, URI, TALINK, CDS and TA resource records. Some of these are experimental, but are pretty straight forward.
- fixed a bug in formatString(); my version was only putting double quotes around strings that have spaces, but apparently ALL strings should have double quotes around them. This is how BIND does it.
- re-organized the Net_DNS2_Lookups initialization code; it no longer creates a global object of itself.
- fixed a bug in the caching code; in some cases it wouldn't cache the same content more than once.
- added an option to use JSON to serialize the cache data rather than using the PHP serialize function. JSON is much faster, but loses the class definition, and becomes a stdClass object.
- fixed a handful of cases where I was using double quotes where a single quote would be fine.</n>
