 <s>GNU Privacy Guard (GPG)</s>
 <d>This package provides an object oriented interface to GNU Privacy Guard (GPG). It requires the GPG executable to be on the system.

Though GPG can support symmetric-key cryptography, this package is intended only to facilitate public-key cryptography.

This package requires PHP version 5.</d>

 <n>API is beta. The native PHP driver is pretty much finished. A PECL-powered gnupg driver will be added in the future.

Changes in this release:
 * cleaned up Key and Signature objects,
 * getPublicKeys() and getPrivateKeys become getKeys(),
 * getPublicFingerprint() and getPrivateFingerprint become getFingerprint(),
 * added ability to specify a key in getKeys(),
 * getFingerprint() can return fingerprint formatted in common formats,
 * throw an exception when you try to delete a public key that has a private key,
 * don't throw an exception when importing duplicate keys, and
 * unit tests are complete for PHP driver.</n>
