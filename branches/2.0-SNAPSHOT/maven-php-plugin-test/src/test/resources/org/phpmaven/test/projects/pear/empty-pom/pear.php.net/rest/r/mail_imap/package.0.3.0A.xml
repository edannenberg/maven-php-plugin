  <summary>Provides a c-client backend for webmail.</summary>
  <description>Mail_IMAP provides a simplified backend for working with the c-client (IMAP) extension. It serves as an OO wrapper for commonly used c-client functions. It provides structure and header parsing as well as body retrieval.
Mail_IMAP provides a simple inbox example that demonstrates its ability to parse and view simple and multipart email messages.
Mail_IMAP also provides a connection wizard to determine the correct protocol and port settings for a remote mail server, all you need to provide is a server, a username and a password.
Mail_IMAP may be used as a webmail backend or as a component in a mailing list manager.
This package requires the c-client extension.  To download the latest version of the c-client extension goto: http://www.php.net/imap.</description>

    <notes>Expanded API -- new methods and functionality.. however BC
has been preserved.
Added getQuota() and setFlags() methods.
Private methods added to simplify the class.
Added _checkIfParsed() method.
Added _scanMultipart() method -- which reduced the file size slightly
and merged/centralized most of the parsing mechanism for body retrieval and
inline/attach member variable creating.
Rearranged some code for logic and preformance.
Added a count check of parts in getParts() method to automatically return
if there is only one message part.
Net_URL removed as a prequisite -- This is only required if the user
isn't supplying an already established IMAP stream.  (Class is now
included in the connect() method).  This ought to reduce the memory
footprint for those forming the IMAP Stream and passing it to the class.
If using a URI abstraction or connection wizard, Net_URL is required.
(Since Net_URL could be used, it remains in the dependencies list)
Added check of resource passed to constructor, to verify it an imap stream.
Optional $seperator argument added for errors() and alerts() methods to
eliminate HTML if the user doesn't want HTML.
Package now tested with IMAP and POP3 protocols.  (NNTP testing still
needed).
This release should be relatively stable.
Beta release should be just around the corner!</notes>
