 <s>An OO-interface for easily retreiving and modifying data in a DB.</s>
 <d>This package is an OO-abstraction to the SQL-Query language, it provides methods such
as setWhere, setOrder, setGroup, setJoin, etc. to easily build queries.
It also provides an easy to learn interface that interacts nicely with HTML-forms using
arrays that contain the column data, that shall be updated/added in a DB.
This package bases on an SQL-Builder which lets you easily build
SQL-Statements and execute them.
NB: this is just a MDB porting from the original DB_QueryTool
written by Wolfram Kriesing and Paolo Panto (vision:produktion, wk@visionp.de).

 <n>- added new method getQueryString() which returns the rendered query
- added setDbInstance() which lets you supply an existing MDB-instance to work with
  using this you dont need to pass a DSN to the constructor!
- use Log 1.7 API
- addWhereSearch now only prefixes known columns as it is supposed to be
- make setLimit also work to unset it</n>
