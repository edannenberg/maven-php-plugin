 <s>User authentication and permission management framework</s>
 <d>LiveUser is a set of classes for dealing with user authentication
  and permission management. Basically, there are three main elements that
  make up this package:

  * The LiveUser class
  * The Auth containers
  * The Perm containers

  The LiveUser class takes care of the login process and can be configured
  to use a certain permission container and one or more different auth containers.
  That means, you can have your users' data scattered amongst many data containers
  and have the LiveUser class try each defined container until the user is found.
  For example, you can have all website users who can apply for a new account online
  on the webserver's local database. Also, you want to enable all your company's
  employees to login to the site without the need to create new accounts for all of
  them. To achieve that, a second container can be defined to be used by the LiveUser class.

  You can also define a permission container of your choice that will manage the rights for
  each user. Depending on the container, you can implement any kind of permission schemes
  for your application while having one consistent API.

  Using different permission and auth containers, it's easily possible to integrate
  newly written applications with older ones that have their own ways of storing permissions
  and user data. Just make a new container type and you're ready to go!

  Currently available are containers using:
  PEAR::DB, PEAR::MDB, PEAR::MDB2, PEAR::XML_Tree and PEAR::Auth.

 <n>- updated MDB2 dependency
- made readConfig() public
- use LIVEUSER_STATUS_AUTHINITERROR and LIVEUSER_STATUS_PERMINITERROR
- removed 'ids' from GLOBALS.php array since this is no longer used in the admin
- added support for table name aliasing
- added updateProperty() method
- dont raise an error when login() was not able to authenticate the user
- storageFactory() is no longer permission specific
- only return false in init() method if an error occured
- always overwrite status with auth failed in login() when the current status is UNKNOWN
- updated a few status message with clearer messages
- delay storing of the auth container instance in a property until its clear that
  the perm container will not produce errors
- kill _auth and _perm property values at the beginning of login()
- added new event &quot;onFailedMapping&quot; when an auth user cannot be mapped to a perm user

authentication
- reworked _readUserData() in the auth containers to optionally read by auth
  user id instead of by handle/passwd (fairly untested)
- made _readUserData() public (and renamed it to readUserData()
- made auth fields dynamic (thx dan)
- updated to use the new auth config layout due to using admin storage
- tweaked disconnect to only disconnect when a new connection was made
- updated Globals.php file (removed all optional fields, added users table alias)

permission
- cleaned up _readImpliedRights()
- fixed bug in readUserRights() that would lead to overwriting the proper right keys
- tweaked disconnect to only disconnect when a new connection was made

installer
- generate auth and perm schema on the fly (removed pre generated ones from cvs)
- separated schema generation and schema writing in two methods in the installer
- forgot to pass 'create' param to installSchema() in installPermSchema()
- use MDB2_Schema as an optional dependency for the schema installer
- improved handling of defaults in the installer
- improved DB seq support in the installer
- options can now be passed to the installer
- severely reworked the install API
- added more infos into the old file names
- updated code with the new auth config layout and as a result removed
  generateAuthSchema() and renamed generatePermSchema() to generateSchema()
- added table name prefix to all indexes, since some rdbms (notably pgsql)
  dont like it if the same index name is used (bug #4593)

examples
- example5 was added again
- demo data for examples 4 and 5 was converted to MDB2_Schema format
- a script to install database based examples can be found under
  docs/examples/demodata.php. Type php demodata.php -h for usage.
- updated examples to use the new auth config layout due to using admin storage
- tweaked error handling on init() call
- use MDB2 in the examples instead of DB</n>
