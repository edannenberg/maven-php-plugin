 <s>Class for creating multilingual webistes.</s>
 <d>Class allows to store and retrieve all the strings on multilingual site in the database. Class connects to any database using PHP PEAR extension. The object should be created for every page. While creation all the strings connected with specific page and the strings connected with all the pages on the site are loaded into variable, so access to them is quite fast and does not overload database server connection.
The version 1.2.1 is intermediate for 1.3 version and has all the features that will appear in 1.2.1 but the gettext support:
- Custom error handling for each language
- Tablenames and table columns in the DB can now be customized
- Constructor that detects if the connection parameter is actual connection handle or the DB connection string
- More ways to get the strings from DB - including the search optimized for DB engines that supports nested queries
- Some bugfixes found during the tests
This version has been tested on PHP 4.2.3 and DB Engines: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL, Oracle.
