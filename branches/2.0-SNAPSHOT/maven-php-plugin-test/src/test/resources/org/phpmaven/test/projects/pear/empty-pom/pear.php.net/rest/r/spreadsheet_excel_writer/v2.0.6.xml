 <s>Package for generating Excel spreadsheets</s>
 <d>Spreadsheet_Excel_Writer was born as a porting of the Spreadsheet::WriteExcel Perl module to PHP. 
It allows writing of Excel spreadsheets without the need for COM objects.
It supports formulas, images (BMP) and all kinds of formatting for text and cells.
It currently supports the BIFF5 format (Excel 5.0), so functionality appeared in the latest Excel versions is not yet available.

 <n>New features:
 - allow semicolon as argument separator (Axel Pratzner)
 - added experimental Excel97 generation. You can test it with setVersion():
   Beware! this method will be deprecated in a future release (when
   Excel97 becomes the default). It is only available for testing
   purposes. Use it at your own risk.
 - strings longer than 255 bytes are now available using the experimental
   Excel97 generation. But not all Excel97 features are available yet!
Bug fixes:
 - Fixed bug #225, error in writeUrl() (jamesn at tocquigny dot com)
 - Fixed bug #59, retval undefined for writeRow() (Bertrand)</n>
