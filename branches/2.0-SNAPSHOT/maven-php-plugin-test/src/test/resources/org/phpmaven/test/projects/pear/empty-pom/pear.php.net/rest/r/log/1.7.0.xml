 <s>Logging utilities</s>
 <d>The Log framework provides an abstracted logging system.  It supports logging to console, file, syslog, SQL, mail, and mcal targets.  It also provides a subject - observer mechanism.

 <n>It is now possible to specific a specific mask that dictates exactly which levels will be logged.  

A number of convenient &quot;shortcut&quot; functions have been added for logging messages at specific log messages.

Two new log handers have been added: the 'error_log' handler wraps PHP's native error_log() function; and the 'win' handler outputs log messages to a separate browser window.

The file log handler has been completely rewritten based on suggestions from Roman Neuhauser.  It no longer buffers log output in memory before writing to the log file.

Greg Beaver submitted a change that allows callers to provide their own Log classes (that existing outside of the PEAR file hierarchy) by including them before invoking a factory() method.</n>
