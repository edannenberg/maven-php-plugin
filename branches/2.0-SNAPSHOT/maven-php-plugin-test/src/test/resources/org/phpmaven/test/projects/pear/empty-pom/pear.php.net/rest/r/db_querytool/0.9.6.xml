 <s>An OO-interface for easily retreiving and modifying data in a DB.</s>
 <d>This package is an OO-abstraction to the SQL-Query language, it provides methods such
as setWhere, setOrder, setGroup, setJoin, etc. to easily build queries.
It also provides an easy to learn interface that interacts nicely with HTML-forms using
arrays that contain the column data, that shall be updated/added in a DB.
This package bases on an SQL-Builder which lets you easily build
SQL-Statements and execute them.

 <n>- bugfix in addMultiple()
- addWhereSearch now only prefixes known columns as it is supposed to be, 
  otherwise it would also prefix aliases with the table name, which is bull...
- quirk in the addLeftJoin() method ... not nice, but v1.0 will be, unit tests pass but thats still not enough proof
- make setLimit also work to unset it</n>
