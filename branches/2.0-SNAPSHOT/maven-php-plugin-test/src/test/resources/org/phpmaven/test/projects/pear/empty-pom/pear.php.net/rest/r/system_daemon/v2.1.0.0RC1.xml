 <s>Turn PHP scripts into Linux daemons</s>
 <d>System_Daemon is a PHP class that allows developers to create their own daemon 
applications on Linux systems. The class is focussed entirely on creating &amp; 
spawning standalone daemons, and for example includes:

   1. Methods to generate OS-specific startup-files (init.d) (currently only 
      Debian/Ubuntu are supported), so that your application gets started on 
      reboot as well.
   2. Methods for logging purposes, also support for PEAR's Log package 
   3. Simple syntax
   5. Can run with or without PEAR (PEAR adds more elegance &amp; functionality, 
      no-PEAR offers functionality like including system_daemon with svn:externals
      and reduced dependencies)
   6. Default signal handlers, but optionally reroute signals to your own 
      handlers. 
   7. Set options like max RAM usage</d>
