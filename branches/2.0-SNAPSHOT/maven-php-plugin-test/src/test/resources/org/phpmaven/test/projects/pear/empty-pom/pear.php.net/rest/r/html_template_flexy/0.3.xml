 <s>An extremely powerful Tokenizer driven Template engine</s>
 <d>HTML_Template_Flexy started it's life as a simplification of HTML_Template_Xipe, 
however in Version 0.2, It became one of the first template engine to use a real Lexer,
rather than regex'es, making it possible to do things like ASP.net or Cold Fusion tags. 
However, it still has a very simple set of goals.
- Very Simple API, easy to learn...
- Targeted at Object based systems - default behavior is to display object variables
- Designed to allow the documentation of available variables using PEAR standards, eg. PHPDoc comments around object variables
- Ability to edit the templates in WYSIWYG HTML editors, without breaking the tags
- Extremely Fast, for normal variables and looping (or blocks), both for designing and runtime.

Features:
- {variable} to echo $object-&gt;variable
- {method()} to echo $object-&gt;method();
- {foreach:var,key,value} to PHP foreach loops
- {if:variable} to PHP If statement
- {if:method()} to PHP If statement
- {else:} and {end:} to close or alternate If statements
- FORM to object mapping, 
- replacement of INPUT, TEXTAREA and SELECT tags with PHP variables or OPTIONS
  FLEXYIGNORE to prevent replacements
- FLEXYSTART/FLEXYSTARTCHILDREN tags to define where output starts/finishes
- support for urlencoded braces {} in HTML attributes.

 <n>Bug fixes
  - allow usage with only constructor options
  - fixed form elements - should be htmlspecialchars, rather than urlencoding
  - new Tokenizer is enabled by default - set 'useLegacy' in config/options to
    use the old regex replacer.
  - no variables are added (eg. o.*, a.* etc. to the page unless useLegacy is set)
  - parsers are now private methods. (internal change)
  
New Features
  - FLEXYSTART and FLEXYSTARTCHILDREN tags added so when use you include sub
    templates, you can avoid including HEAD etc. tags.</n>
