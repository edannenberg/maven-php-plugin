 <s>Parse, modify, and create MARC records</s>
 <d>The standard for machine-readable cataloging (MARC) records is documented at http://loc.gov/marc/. This package enables you to read existing MARC records from a file, string, or (using the YAZ extension), from a Z39.50 source. You can also use this package to create new MARC records.

This package is based on the PHP MARC package, originally called &quot;php-marc&quot;, that is part of the Emilda Project (http://www.emilda.org).  Christoffer Landtman generously agreed to make the &quot;php-marc&quot; code available under the GNU LGPL so it could be used as the basis of this PEAR package.</d>
