 <s>Generate a &quot;Tag Cloud&quot; in HTML and visualize tags by their frequency.
Additionally visualizes each tag's age.</s>
 <d>This package can be used to generate tag clouds. The output is HTML and CSS.

A Tag Cloud is a visual representation of so-called &quot;tags&quot; or keywords, that do
have a different font size depending on how often they occur on the page/blog. A
less used synonym for a Tag Cloud that came up before Web 2.0 is the term
&quot;weightet list&quot;. Popular examples of Tag Clouds and their use can be found in
action at pages like Flickr, Del.icio.us and Technorati. A nice overview on what
a Tag Cloud can actually do can be found at WikiPedia:
http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_cloud

This package does not only visualize frequency, but also timeline information.
The newer the tag is, the deeper its color will be; older tags will have a
lighter color.

The main goal of &quot;HTML_TagCloud&quot; is to provide an easy to implement and
configureable Tag Cloud solution that is suitable for any PHP-based webapp.

Features:
 - set up each tag's name, URL, frequency, age
 - customizable colors
 - customizable font-sizes</d>
