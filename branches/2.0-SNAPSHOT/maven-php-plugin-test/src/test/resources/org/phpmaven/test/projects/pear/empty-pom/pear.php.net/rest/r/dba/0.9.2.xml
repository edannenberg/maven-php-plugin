 <n>This release fixes a bug in the firstkey() function of the builtin drivers (gdbm, db3) and adds the missing size() function.

Note that many of the pieces that were included with the earlier developer releases, such as the table manager and SQL parser, have been split into separate packages to be released again soon.</n>
