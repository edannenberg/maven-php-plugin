 <s>Creates XML data from SQL queries</s>
 <d>XML_Query2XML allows you to transform the records retrieved
with one or more SQL SELECT queries into XML data. Very simple to
highly complex transformations are supported. Is was written with
performance in mind and can handle large amounts of data. No XSLT needed!
Major features:
1. XML_Query2XML works with the classes provided by PHP5's DOM XML extension
2. minimum effort necessary to get the simple jobs done
3. highly configurable for more complex tasks
4. ISO/IEC 9075-14:2005 support: mapping of SQL identifiers to XML names
5. works with any database that is supported by PEAR DB, PEAR MDB2 or ADOdb
6. easy integration of other XML data sources (e.g. raw XML data stored in the DB)
7. debugging and logging features
8. provides profiling features
9. in-depth documentation and case studies: tutorials and API documentation
10. 678 phpt unit tests</d>

 <n>This second stable release contains a couple of great new features:
- it's now possible to integrate other XML data sources (e.g. XML stored in the DB)
  - XML unserialization support: see the ampersand prefix
  - you can now return DOMNode instances from callback functions
- non-static methods can now be used as callbacks by
  implementing the new XML_Query2XML_Callback interface

The smaller changes include:
- cleaned up API docs
- hidden_container_prefix can now be set using setGlobalOption()
- numerous CS fixes in the tutorial
- now using MDB2 instead of DB in all examples
- documented multi-column primary key support
- now comes with 678 unit tests (tested with MySQL and PostgreSQL)</n>
