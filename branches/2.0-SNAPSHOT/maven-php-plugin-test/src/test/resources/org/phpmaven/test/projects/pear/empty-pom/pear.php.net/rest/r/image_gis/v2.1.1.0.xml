 <s>Visualization of GIS data.</s>
 <d>Generating maps on demand can be a hard job as most often you don't
have the maps you need in digital form.
But you can generate your own maps based on raw, digital data files
which are available for free on the net.
This package provides a parser for the most common format for
geographical data, the Arcinfo/E00 format as well as renderers to
produce images using GD or Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG).

 <n>+ Added caching of parsed data files.

+ Added getRange() method to the Image_GIS and Image_GIS_Renderer
  classes.

* Changed the Image_GIS constructor to accept an associative
  parameter array as its only argument.

  Note: This breaks backwards compatibility.

* The SVG renderer now uses the XML_SVG package instead of the
  XML_Tree package.

* Factored the handling of Line Sets out into a separate class.

* Fixed handling of negative coordinates.

* Fixed a bug that kept a debugging message from beeing printed.

* Fixed incompatibilities with PHP 5.</n>
