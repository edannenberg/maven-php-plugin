 <s>fbsql MDB2 driver</s>
 <d>This is the Frontbase SQL MDB2 driver.

 <n>Warning: this release features numerous BC breaks!

There have been considerable improvements to the datatype, manager and reverse
modules. However this driver should be considered unmaintained and likely broken.

- increased php dependency to 4.3.0 due to the usage of the streams API since beta5
- ensure that instance is connected before using connection property in tableInfo()
- alterTable now needs the full definition to work (use getTableFieldDefinition
 from Reverse module if you do not have a definition at hand) this eliminates the need
 of the declaration part in the alterTable array.
- ensure that instance is connected before using connection property in tableInfo()
- fix PHP4.4 breakage
- moved getInsertID() into core as lastInsertID()
- moved max_text_length property into the fbsql datatype module
- use !empty() instead of isset() in fetchRow to determine if result cols were bound or result types were set
- moved all private fetch mode fix methods into _fixResultArrayValues() for performance reasons
- renamed MDB2_PORTABILITY_LOWERCASE to MDB2_PORTABILITY_FIX_CASE and use 'field_case' option to determine if to upper- or lowercase (CASE_LOWER/CASE_UPPER)
- count() -&gt; !empty() where possible
- use array_map() instead of array_flip(array_change_key_case(array_flip())) to fix case of array values
- use array_key_exists() instead of isset() where possible
- changed structure of field add/remove/change in alterTable() to match MDB2_Schema
- return 0 for manipulation queries when disable_query is enabled
- tweaked handling of notnull and default in field reverse engineering</n>
