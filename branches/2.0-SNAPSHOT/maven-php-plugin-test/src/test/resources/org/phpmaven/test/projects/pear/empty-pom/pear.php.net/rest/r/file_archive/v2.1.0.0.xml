 <n>+ Bug 4159 (PHP4 compatibility)
+ Bug 4165 (Better USTAR handling in tar files)
+ The package now use temporary files to reduce the amount of memory used
  when reading or writing large archives. The following indicates the current
  memory usage of the different reader / writers
  - Tar writer: constant memory usage
  - GZip writer: constant memory usage, temporary file
  - BZ2 writer: constant memory usage, temporary file
  - ZIP writer: size of the largest file written to the archive
  
  - Tar reader: constant memory usage
  - GZip reader: constant memory usage, temporary file
  - BZ2 reader: constant memory usage, temporary file
  - ZIP reader: size of the largest file read from the archive
  
  The temporary files are created in the current directory. Their name start with
  far, their extension is tmp. They are automatically deleted when the reader / writer
  is closed.</n>
