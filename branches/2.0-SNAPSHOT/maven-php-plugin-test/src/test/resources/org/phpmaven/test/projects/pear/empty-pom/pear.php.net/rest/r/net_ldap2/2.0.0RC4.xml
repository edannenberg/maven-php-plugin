 <s>Object oriented interface for searching and manipulating LDAP-entries</s>
 <d>Net_LDAP2 is the successor of Net_LDAP which is a clone of Perls Net::LDAP
                object interface to directory servers. It does contain most of Net::LDAPs
                features but has some own too.
                 With Net_LDAP2 you have:
                 * A simple object-oriented interface to connections, searches entries and filters.
                 * Support for tls and ldap v3.
                 * Simple modification, deletion and creation of ldap entries.
                 * Support for schema handling.

                 Net_LDAP2 layers itself on top of PHP's existing ldap extensions.</d>

 <n>* Net_LDAP2_Filter::create*() methods are declared static now
* Net_LDAP2 is able to reconnect now in case link is down during operation (thanks Del)
* Complex updates fail: under some circumstances, $entry-&gt;update() will fail. This is
  caused by mandatory attributes set and the internal behaviour of Net_LDAP2. A
  workaround is documented in the code and in the user manual.
* Bugfixes in Dels patches. Soemtimes there where endless loops and deleting entries
  did not always succeed.
* Bugfix to reset unicodePwd (Active Directory): a new $force parameter was introduced to Net_LDAP2_Entry-&gt;replace()
  that forces &quot;replace&quot; mode. If not set and attribute is empty (or could not be read like in the AD case)
  replace() resulted in Net_LDAP2 thinking it should add the attribute. This can now be overriden.
* Bugfix in unit tests: the Net_LDAP2Test suite had huge memory consumtion caused by a little error in
  Net_LDAP2-&gt;checkLDAPExtension(). If that method is called before any Net_LDAP class was instanciated, a PEAR
  error is returned instead of the documented Net_LDAP2_Error which causes the unit test to plot out very much
  debug information.</n>
