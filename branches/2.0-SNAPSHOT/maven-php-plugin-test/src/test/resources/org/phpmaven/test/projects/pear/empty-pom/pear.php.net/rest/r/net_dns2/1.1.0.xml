 <s>PHP5 Resolver library used to communicate with a DNS server.</s>
 <d>Provides (roughly) the same functionality as Net_DNS, but using PHP5 objects, exceptions for error handling, better sockets support.

This release is (in most cases) 2x - 10x faster than Net_DNS, as well as includes more RR's (including DNSSEC RR's), and improved sockets and streams support.</d>

 <n>- added support for signing requests using SIG(0); uses the PHP openssl extension, and only currently supports RSA- DSA support in PHP is limited.
- moved the signing code for SIG(0) and TSIG to the base class so it can be used for both updates and queries (for AXFR)
- added a simple local cache feature using shared memory (shmop extension) or using a flat fille. This feature is disabled by default.
- added support for the ATMA resource record (supported in Windows)</n>
