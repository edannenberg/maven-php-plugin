 <s>Control an Asterisk PBX server from PHP</s>
 <d>Asterisk - an open source PBX - provides a manager API which enables a developer to send commands to the server to administer and control an array of PBX function. Examples of which are call origination, call monitoring, queue manipulation and status queries.

Other PHP libraries have been produced (off-Pear) for this but are relatively low level and require a knowledge of the Asterisk command interface.

This class provides a high level interface to the Asterisk manager API enabling a developer to control an Asterisk server via their PHP application/script using clearly named methods.</d>
