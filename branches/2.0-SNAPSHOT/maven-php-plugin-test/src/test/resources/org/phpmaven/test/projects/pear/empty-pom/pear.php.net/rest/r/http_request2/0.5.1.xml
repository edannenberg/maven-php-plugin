 <s>Provides an easy way to perform HTTP requests.</s>
 <d>PHP5 rewrite of HTTP_Request package. Provides cleaner API and pluggable
Adapters. Currently available are:
  * Socket adapter, based on old HTTP_Request code,
  * Curl adapter, wraps around PHP's cURL extension,
  * Mock adapter, to use for testing packages dependent on HTTP_Request2.
Supports POST requests with data and file uploads, basic and digest 
authentication, cookies, proxies, gzip and deflate encodings, redirects,
monitoring the request progress with Observers...</d>

  with empty request body (request #16799).
* CURLOPT_NOBODY option is now set when doing HEAD requests with Curl adapter.</n>
