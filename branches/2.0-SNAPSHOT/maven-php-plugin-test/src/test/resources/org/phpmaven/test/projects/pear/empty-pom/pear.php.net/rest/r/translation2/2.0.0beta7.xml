 <s>Class for multilingual applications management.</s>
 <d>This class provides an easy way to retrieve all the strings for a multilingual site from a data source (i.e. db).
The following containers are provided, more will follow:
- PEAR::DB
- PEAR::MDB
- PEAR::MDB2
- gettext
- XML
- PEAR::DB_DataObject (experimental)
It is designed to reduce the number of queries to the db, caching the results when possible.
An Admin class is provided to easily manage translations (add/remove a language, add/remove a string).
Currently, the following decorators are provided:
- CacheLiteFunction (for file-based caching)
- CacheMemory (for memory-based caching)
- DefaultText (to replace empty strings with their keys)
- ErrorText (to replace empty strings with a custom error text)
- Iconv (to switch from/to different encodings)
- Lang (resort to fallback languages for empty strings)
- SpecialChars (replace html entities with their hex codes)
- UTF-8 (to convert UTF-8 strings to ISO-8859-1)
 
</d>

 <n>- added some options to the DefaultText decoration, now it is more customizable
  (thanks to Rolf 'Red' Ochsenbein)
- added a __clone() method to clone the internal object references
  (bug #3641, patch by Olivier Guilyardi)
- Some fixes to the XML container, many thanks to Olivier Guilyardi:
  * fixed bug #3408: empty data sets were not correctly handled;
  * fixed bug #3420: get a shared file lock instead of an exclusive one;
  * fixed bug #3498: saveData() is not registered multiple times as shutdown
    function anymore; optimized saving when save_on_shutdown is set to false.
- added blank_on_missing option to the gettext container, which makes it
  behave like the other containers and automatically disables native mode;
  * see bug #4002
- fixed bug #4476: gettext container not working without the gettext extension
  (thanks to sergey at pushok dot com)
- added setContainerOptions() method to alter some container options after 
  the object instantiation (bug #2508)
- some minor fixes</n>
