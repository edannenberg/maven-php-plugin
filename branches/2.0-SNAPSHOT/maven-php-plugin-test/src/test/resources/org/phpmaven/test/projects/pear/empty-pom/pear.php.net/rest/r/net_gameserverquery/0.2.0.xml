 <s>An interface to query and return information from a game server</s>
 <d>Net_GameServerQuery provides an interface for querying game servers
</d>
 <da>2004-11-23 18:32:42</da>
 <n>The structure of the class has been completely changed, along with the API.
The API is now relatively stable, though still subject to change.

Supports simultaneous querying of servers, so many servers can be queried relatively quickly.

The class now fetches all data from game servers, including rules, status, players and ping.
Many protocols have been implemented, but still alpha quality.</n>
