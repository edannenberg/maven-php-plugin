 <s>sqlite MDB2 driver</s>
 <d>This is the SQLite MDB2 driver.</d>
 <da>2006-11-03 08:13:45</da>
 <n>note:
- this driver only supports SQLite version 2.x databases
- the replace test fails because sqlite reports an incorrect affected rows
  value when no existing data was replaced
- the multi_query test failes because this is not supported by ext/sqlite
- the savepoint test failes because this is not supported by sqlite
- the case sensitive search test fails because this is not supported by SQLite
- the pattern escaping test fails because this is not supported by SQLite
- do not skip id generation in nextId() when creating a sequence on demand
  becazse this prevents lastInsertID() from working
- migrated to package.xml version 2

open todo items:
- fix pattern escaping using GLOB instead of LIKE or create an register own implementation of LIKE</n>
