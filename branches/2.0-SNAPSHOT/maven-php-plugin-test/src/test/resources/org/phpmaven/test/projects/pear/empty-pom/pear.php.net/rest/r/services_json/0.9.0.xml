 <s>PHP implementaion of json_encode/decode</s>
 <d>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation, http://json.org) is a lightweight data-interchange format. 
    It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. 
    It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language, Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999. 
    This feature can also be found in Python. JSON is a text format that is completely language independent 
    but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including
     C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, TCL, and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal
     data-interchange language.

    This package provides a simple encoder and decoder for JSON notation. It is intended for use
     with client-side Javascript applications that make use of HTTPRequest to perform server 
    communication functions - data can be encoded into JSON notation for use in a client-side
     javascript, or decoded from incoming Javascript requests. JSON format is native to Javascript, 
    and can be directly eval()'ed with no further parsing overhead.</d>

 <n>Released into pear with minor changes to original proposal
  - encode() - encodes and adds http headers
  - encodeUnsafe() - encodes only
  - Some UTF8 fixes (better handling of invalid characters)</n>
