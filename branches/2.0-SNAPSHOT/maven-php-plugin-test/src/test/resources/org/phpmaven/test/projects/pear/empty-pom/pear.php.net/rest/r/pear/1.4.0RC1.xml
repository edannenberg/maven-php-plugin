 <n>This is a major milestone release for PEAR.  In addition to several killer features,
  every single element of PEAR has a regression test, and so stability is much higher
  than any previous PEAR release.

  New features in a nutshell:
  * full support for channels
  * pre-download dependency validation
  * new package.xml 2.0 format allows tremendous flexibility while maintaining BC
  * support for optional dependency groups and limited support for sub-packaging
  * robust dependency support
  * full dependency validation on uninstall
  * remote install for hosts with only ftp access - no more problems with
    restricted host installation
  * full support for mirroring
  * support for bundling several packages into a single tarball
  * support for static dependencies on a uri-based package
  * support for custom file roles and installation tasks

  Specific changes from 1.4.0b2:
  * fix Bug #5319: broken .pearrc or pear.conf are correctly detected
  * fix Bug #5331: PEAR_Exception should take any Exception as cause
  * fix Bug #5385: small fix to PEAR/Command/Package.php and RunTest.php
  * fix Bug #5374: package.dtd is broken, package-1.0 is not synced
  * fix Bug #5394: postinstallscript sub-tags need namespace prefix</n>
