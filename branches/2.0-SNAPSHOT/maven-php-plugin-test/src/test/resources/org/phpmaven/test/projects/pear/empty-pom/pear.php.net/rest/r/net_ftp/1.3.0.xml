 <s>Net_FTP provides an OO interface to the PHP FTP functions plus some additions</s>
 <d>Net_FTP allows you to communicate with FTP servers in a more comfortable way
than the native FTP functions of PHP do. The class implements everything nativly
supported by PHP and additionally features like recursive up- and downloading,
dircreation and chmodding. It although implements an observer pattern to allow
for example the view of a progress bar.</d>

 <n>Another month of testing did not bring any more critical bugs to daylight. Therefore 
and because PEAR 1.4.0 will depend optionally on Net_FTP I decided to run the next 
stable release. The following changes were made to the package files:

 - Updated year.
 - Updated docblocks regarding the new standard.
 - Fixed whitespace issues.
 - Fixed bug 3362: bug in Net_FTP::_rm_file.
 - Added PEAR 1.4 compatible package2.xml (package.xml version 2.0).</n>
