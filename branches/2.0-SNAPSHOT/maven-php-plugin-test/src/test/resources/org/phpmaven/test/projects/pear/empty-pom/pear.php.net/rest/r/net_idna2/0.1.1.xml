 <s>Punycode encoding and decoding.</s>
 <d>This package helps you to encode and decode punycode strings easily.</d>
 <da>2010-12-09 17:35:29</da>
 <n>* Added initial support for IDNA2008. This is needed for characters like the German
  &quot;Eszett&quot; which would otherwise be turned into &quot;ss&quot; during nameprep.
  Use $n-&gt;setParams('version', '2008') to use the &quot;new&quot; IDNA-encoding. Default is still
  IDNA2003 for backwards-compatibility.
  Further aspects of IDNA2008-encoding (for example some checks) should be added later
  according to RFCs.
