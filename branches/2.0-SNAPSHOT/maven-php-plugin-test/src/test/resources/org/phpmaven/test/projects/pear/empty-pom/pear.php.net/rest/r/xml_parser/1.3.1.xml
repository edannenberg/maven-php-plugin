 <s>XML parsing class based on PHP's bundled expat</s>
 <d>This is an XML parser based on PHPs built-in xml extension.
It supports two basic modes of operation: &quot;func&quot; and &quot;event&quot;.  In &quot;func&quot; mode, it will look for a function named after each element (xmltag_ELEMENT for start tags and xmltag_ELEMENT_ for end tags), and in &quot;event&quot; mode it uses a set of generic callbacks.

Since version 1.2.0 there's a new XML_Parser_Simple class that makes parsing of most XML documents easier, by automatically providing a stack for the elements.
Furthermore its now possible to split the parser from the handler object, so you do not have to extend XML_Parser anymore in order to parse a document with it.</d>
