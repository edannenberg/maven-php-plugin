 <n>+ Improved zip reader (File_Archive_Zip_Reader implements more options of the PKZip standard)

+ Some change in the Cache_File use:
  - The fileNameProtection is forced to false when setting the cache option
  - Add a File_Archive_cleanCache function
    To remove the cached compressed version of the files that are no longer present on the system, call
    $cache-&gt;clean(false, 'callback_File_Archive_cleanCache');
    where $cache is the Cache_Lite object passed to File_Archive.
    
+ Introduce 'blockSize' option that indicates the size of the blocs copied from a reader to a writer when
  extracting a file. The default has been set to 64kB but is subject to change in future releases
  
+ File_Archive::cache to cache a reader if you read it several times in the same script

+ 'cacheCondition' option. With this option, you can specify you want to cache all the http
  transfer for example. Caching an http transfer ensure that the file won't be downloaded several times
  
+ File_Archive::readUploadedFile creates a reader on an uploaded file</n>
