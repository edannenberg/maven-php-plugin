 <n>This package status has moved from 'beta' to 'devel', where it
    really should have been all along. Also, this is the first
    release that is packaged correctly, so it should work with the
    PEAR installer now.    

    * Fixed problem inserting into a newly created table in
      DBA_Relational
    * Added support for functions as default values in DBA_Table
      (currently only time() works)
    * Added a SQL parser/lexer. It currently understands 'create
    table', 'insert into' and much that goes with them.
    * Added two system fields on rows; _rowid and _timestamp
    * Primary keys can consist of more than one field
    * Changed DBA_Sql; it now holds functions for interacting with
      a DBA database using SQL. See test_sql_dba.php for examples.
    * General fixes/cleanups/messups</n>
