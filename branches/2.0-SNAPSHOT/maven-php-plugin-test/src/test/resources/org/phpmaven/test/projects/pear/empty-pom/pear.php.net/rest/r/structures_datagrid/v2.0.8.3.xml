 <s>A tabular structure that contains a record set of data for paging and sorting purposes.</s>
 <d>This package offers a toolkit to render out a datagrid in HTML format as well as
many other formats such as an XML Document, an Excel Spreadsheet, an XUL Document and more.
It also offers paging and sorting functionallity to limit the data that is presented and processed.
This concept is based on the .NET Framework DataGrid control and works very well with database and XML result sets.</d>
