 <s>database abstraction layer</s>
 <d>PEAR MDB2 is a merge of the PEAR DB and Metabase php database abstraction layers.

It provides a common API for all supported RDBMS. The main difference to most
other DB abstraction packages is that MDB2 goes much further to ensure
portability. Among other things MDB2 features:
* An OO-style query API
* A DSN (data source name) or array format for specifying database servers
* Datatype abstraction and on demand datatype conversion
* Various optional fetch modes to fix portability issues
* Portable error codes
* Sequential and non sequential row fetching as well as bulk fetching
* Ability to make buffered and unbuffered queries
* Ordered array and associative array for the fetched rows
* Prepare/execute (bind) emulation
* Sequence emulation
* Replace emulation
* Limited sub select emulation
* Row limit support
* Transactions support
* Large Object support
* Index/Unique Key/Primary Key support
* Autoincrement emulation
* Module framework to load advanced functionality on demand
* Ability to read the information schema
* RDBMS management methods (creating, dropping, altering)
* Reverse engineering schemas from an existing DB
* SQL function call abstraction
* Full integration into the PEAR Framework
* PHPDoc API documentation

 <n>- phpdoc and folding mark fixes (thx Laurent and Stoyan)
- added getTriggerDefinition() in the Reverse module
- added listTableViews() in the Manager module
- explicitly set is_manip parameter to false for transaction debug calls
- various minor tweaks to error messages, phpdoc and adding stub methods to the
  common driver
- added row seeking support to fetchOne()
- added ability to hint that a constraint is a primary key in dropConstraint()
- since we no longer complain about primary keys not being called primary we can
  remove the necessary hacks in the test suite
- improved LOB tests in the test suite
- do not require Manager module for core API tests
- added support for fixed and variable types for 'text' in declarations,
  as well as in reverse engineering (Request #1523)
- updated MAINTAINERS to current status
- readded STATUS document, still needs to be filled with content
- tweaked handling of error objects inside raiseError()
- made _doQuery() return a reference
- added userinfo's to all raiseError calls that previously had none
- added bindValueArray()
- use bindValueArray() instead of bindParamArray() in all internal calls
- removed the skeleton drivers, since its too much work to maintain them
  and there are plenty of sample drivers to look at
- fixed example due to API change in MDB2_Schema (Bug #7575)
- added 'prepared_statements' supported meta data setting
- do not retrieve lob in the stream constructor and streams_eof()
- strip of file:// prefix in writeLOBToFile()
- typo fix ressource/resource in LOB array
- removed lob property from the LOB streams wrapper (references are always
  shaky business in PHP so lets use them as little as possible)
- fixed _destroyLOB() API to match other private LOB methods
- fixed phpdoc comments of all private LOB methods
- typo fix in autoincrement test
- reworked index/constraint creation to not affected unnecessary reverse tests

Note: Due to changes in generation of declaration statements you may need to
update your test databases (for example by rerunning the MDB2_Schema
installation using the CVS version or a release greater than 0.5.0)

open todo items:
- handle autoincrement fields in alterTable()
- add support for ADODB style &quot;smart transactions&quot;:
