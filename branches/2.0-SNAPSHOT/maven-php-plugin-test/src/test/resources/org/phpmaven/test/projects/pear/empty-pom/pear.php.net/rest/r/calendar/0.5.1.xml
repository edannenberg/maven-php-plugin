 <s>A package for building Calendar data structures (irrespective of output)</s>
 <d>Calendar provides an API for building Calendar data structures. Using
the simple iterator and it's &quot;query&quot; API, a user interface can easily be
built on top of the calendar data structure, at the same time easily connecting it
to some kind of underlying data store, where &quot;event&quot; information is
being held.

It provides different calculation &quot;engines&quot; the default being based on
Unix timestamps (offering fastest performance) with an alternative using PEAR::Date
which extends the calendar past the limitations of Unix timestamps. Other engines
should be implementable for other types of calendar (e.g. a Chinese Calendar based
on lunar cycles).

 <n>* Fixed bug in Calendar_Week::setSelection():
  the &quot;selected&quot; property was set, but not the decorated object.
* Fixed bug in Calendar_Month_[Weekdays|Weeks]:
  the number of empty days at the beginning of the month could be
  wrong when the adjust() method was called to fix an invalid date.</n>
