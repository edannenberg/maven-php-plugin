 <n>[+] Added   [-] Fixed   [*] Improved   [!] Note
[+] German umlauts are now converted, e.g. &quot;Ã¤&quot; to &quot;ae&quot;. Although umlauts should be working in DTA files by official specification, in fact they doesn't worked.
[-] Fixed a bug that caused false amounts of money if exactly one number after the point was given in the amount (e.g. 12.3). Thanks to Matthias Jaekle for the reference.
[!] Payment_DTA is NOT designed for account data validation. It needs valid data to work, and this also means NO SPACES in bank codes or account numbers.</n>
