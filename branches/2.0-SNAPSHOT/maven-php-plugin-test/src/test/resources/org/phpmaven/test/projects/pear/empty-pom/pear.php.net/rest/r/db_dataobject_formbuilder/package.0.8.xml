  <summary>Class to automatically build HTML_QuickForm objects from a DB_DataObject-derived class</summary>
  <description>DB_DataObject_FormBuilder will aid you in rapid application development using the packages
DB_DataObject and HTML_QuickForm. For having a quick but working prototype of your application,
simply model the database, run DataObject´s createTable script over it and write a script
that passes one of the resulting objects to the FormBuilder class.
The FormBuilder will automatically generate a simple but working HTML_QuickForm object that you can
use to test your application. It also provides a processing method that will automatically detect
if an insert() or update() command has to be executed after the form has been submitted.
If you have set up DataObject´s links.ini file correctly, it will also automatically detect
if a table field is a foreign key and will populate a selectbox with the linked table´s entries.
There are many optional parameters that you can place in your DataObjects.ini or in the properties
of your derived classes, that you can use to fine-tune the form-generation, gradually turning
the prototypes into fully-featured forms, and you can take control at any stage of the process.</description>
