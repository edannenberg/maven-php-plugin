 <s>A tabular structure that contains a record set of data for paging and sorting purposes.</s>
 <d>This package offers a toolkit to render out a datagrid in HTML format as well as
many other formats such as an XML Document, an Excel Spreadsheet, a Smarty Template and more.
It also offers paging and sorting functionallity to limit the data that is presented.
This concept is based on the .NET Framework DataGrid control and works very well with database and XML result sets.

 <n>The &quot;formatter&quot; method in the Column object now supports OO calls (Bug #1584).
The allowEmptyRows attribute in the column object now has a method.
The HTML Renderer class methods were modified to allow setting of all attributes instead of hardcoded to individual attributes.
Fixed notice errors (Bug #1545)
Added more functionality to working with the Pager object (Bug #1501)
Fixed Pager class instantiation to work with PHP5 (Bug #1371)</n>
