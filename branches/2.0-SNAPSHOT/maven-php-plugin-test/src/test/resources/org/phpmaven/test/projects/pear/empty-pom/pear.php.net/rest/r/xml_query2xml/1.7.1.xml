 <n>This release implements the following additions:
- Caching is now implemented as a saparate driver that is automatically
  wrapped around any other driver if caching is activated.
  This reduces the codebase of Query2XML.php.
- Refactoring of internal classes.
Note: No changes were introduced since 1.7.1RC1.</n>
