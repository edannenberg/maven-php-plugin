 <s>Database Abstraction Layer</s>
 <d>DB is a database abstraction layer providing:
* an OO-style query API
* portability features that make programs written
   for one DBMS work with other DBMS's
* a DSN (data source name) format for specifying
   database servers
* prepare/execute (bind) emulation for databases
   that don't support it natively
* a result object for each query response
* portable error codes
* sequence emulation
* sequential and non-sequential row fetching as
   well as bulk fetching
* formats fetched rows as associative arrays,
   ordered arrays or objects
* row limit support
* transactions support
* table information interface
* DocBook and PHPDoc API documentation

DB layers itself on top of PHP's existing
database extensions.  The currently supported
extensions are:
dbase, fbsql, interbase, informix,
msql, mssql, mysql, mysqli,
oci8, odbc, pgsql, sqlite and sybase.

DB is compatible with both PHP 4 and PHP 5.

 <n>=============
ENHANCEMENTS:

- all:
When connecting with an array as the DSN and the
'dbsyntax' element is not set, parseDSN() now
sets it to 'phptype', just like what happens when
parsing a DSN string.  (danielc)

- ifx:
Add tableInfo().  (peterwb@iafrica.com, danielc)

- mysql, odbc(access):
Added DB_PORTABILITY_ERRORS portability option
to ensure consistent mapping of errors between
DBMS's. In mysql this changes duplicate key
constraints from DB_ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS to
DB_ERROR_CONSTRAINT. In access MS's ODBC
driver mistakenly reports 'no such field' as
'too few parameters' so this option maps the
error back to the standard
DB_ERROR_NOSUCHFIELD.  (danielc)

- ibase, mssql, odbc, pgsql, sqlite:
Duplicate key constraint violations mapped to
DB_ERROR_CONSTRAINT.  (danielc)


=============
BUGS FIXED:

- oci8:
Change duplicate key constraint mapping from 
DB_ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS to DB_ERROR_CONSTRAINT
for portability with other DBMS's.  Since the
initial mapping was added in 1.6.0RC1, this
isn't a backwards compatibility issue.  (danielc)

- oci8:
Have modifyLimitQuery() quote all identifiers in
order to avoid problems when certain queries with
quoted identifiers are passed to limitQuery().
Bug 679. (danielc)

- all:
In modifyLimitQuery(), if errors, put bad query
into last_query to help debugging.  (danielc)

- all:
In limitQuery(), check if return from
modifyLimitQuery() is an error and return that
error if problems.  (danielc)

- all:
All drivers with tableInfo() methods had bug
introduced in 1.6.0RC5 that caused
'undefined function' errors when lowercasing
portability was off.  Bug 724.  (danielc)

- ibase:
Resolve 'undefined variable flags' notice when
using tableInfo() under certain conditions.
(danielc)

- ibase:
Use upper case for RELATION_NAME in
_ibaseFieldFlags() query to make tableInfo() work.
