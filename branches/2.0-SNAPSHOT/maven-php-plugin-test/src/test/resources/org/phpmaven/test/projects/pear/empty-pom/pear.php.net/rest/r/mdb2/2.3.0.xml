 <s>database abstraction layer</s>
 <d>PEAR MDB2 is a merge of the PEAR DB and Metabase php database abstraction layers.

It provides a common API for all supported RDBMS. The main difference to most
other DB abstraction packages is that MDB2 goes much further to ensure
portability. MDB2 provides most of its many features optionally that
can be used to construct portable SQL statements:
* Object-Oriented API
* A DSN (data source name) or array format for specifying database servers
* Datatype abstraction and on demand datatype conversion
* Various optional fetch modes to fix portability issues
* Portable error codes
* Sequential and non sequential row fetching as well as bulk fetching
* Ability to make buffered and unbuffered queries
* Ordered array and associative array for the fetched rows
* Prepare/execute (bind) named and unnamed placeholder emulation
* Sequence/autoincrement emulation
* Replace emulation
* Limited sub select emulation
* Row limit emulation
* Transactions/savepoint support
* Large Object support
* Index/Unique Key/Primary Key support
* Pattern matching abstraction
* Module framework to load advanced functionality on demand
* Ability to read the information schema
* RDBMS management methods (creating, dropping, altering)
* Reverse engineering schemas from an existing database
* SQL function call abstraction
* Full integration into the PEAR Framework
* PHPDoc API documentation</d>

 <n>- added charset and collation support to field declaration
- added SQL comments and quoted identifier handling inside prepared statement parser
- expanded length/scale support for numeric types (Request #7170)
- added statement_format option to make it possible to define the name used for
  native statements if supported
- fixed bug when setting MDB2_PREPARE_RESULT in autoExecute()
- fixed notice in exec() call in autoExecute()
- reversed if logic in MDB2::fileExists checking to be more fool proof with
  safe_mode restrictions (Bug #8296)
- moved CREATE TABLE query generation in a separate method for reuse in the drivers
- added testLOBRead to test multiple LOB reads
- fixed getColumnNames() optional parameter handling (Bug #8857)
- phpdoc fix for fetchCol/fetchAll
- added an extra if in the autoExecute method of the Extended driver (Bug #8878)
- expanded tableInfo() tests
- expanded prepare() tests
- fix the incorrect use of currID() for lastInsertID() emulation (Bug #9107)
- add test for lastInsertID()
- also output php version in test results
- added supported 'new_link'
- dropped use of track_errors because 5.2.0 causes php_errormsg to not get
  populated if a custom error handler is set and it was causing issues for
  safe_mode users anyways
- added some error handling into the bindValues()/bindParams() methods (Bug #9133)
- bindValue() does not need values by reference
- fix issue in execute() when parameter is a scalar integer of 0 (Bug #9158)
- implemented stream_stat() method (Bug #9092)
- better deal with non scalar arguments in test helper function as 5.2.0 explodes otherwise
- extracted _skipDelimitedStrings() method from prepare()
- added test for _skipDelimitedStrings() method
- migrated to package.xml version 2

open todo items:
- handle autoincrement fields in alterTable()
- add length handling to LOB reverse engineering
- expand charset support in schema management and result set handling (Request #4666)
- add EXPLAIN abstraction
- add cursor support along the lines of PDO (Request #3660 etc.)
- add PDO based drivers, especially a driver to support SQLite 3 (Request #6907)
- add support to export/import in CSV format
- add more functions to the Function module (MD5(), IFNULL(), LENGTH() etc.)
- add support for database/table/row LOCKs
- add support for FOREIGN KEYs and CHECK (ENUM as possible mysql fallback) constraints
- generate STATUS file from test suite results and allow users to submit test results
- explore use of install groups (pear install MDB2#mysql)
- add support for full text index creation and querying
- add tests to check if the RDBMS specific handling with portability options
  disabled behaves as expected
- handle implicit commits (like for DDL) in any affected driver (mysql, sqlite..)
- add a getTableFieldsDefinitions() method to be used in tableInfo()
- drop ILIKE from matchPattern() and instead add a second parameter to
  handle case sensitivity with arbitrary operators
- add charset and collation support to field declaration in all drivers
- handle LOBs in buffered result sets (Request #8793)</n>
