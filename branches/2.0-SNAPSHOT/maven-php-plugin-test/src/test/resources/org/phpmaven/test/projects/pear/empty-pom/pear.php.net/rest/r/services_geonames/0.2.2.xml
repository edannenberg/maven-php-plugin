 <s>A PHP5 interface to the GeoNames public API</s>
 <d>Services_GeoNames is a PHP5 interface to the various webservices offered by
the GeoNames project.

The GeoNames database contains over 8,000,000 geographical names corresponding 
to over 6,500,000 unique features. All features are categorized into one out 
of nine feature classes and further subcategorized into one out of 645 feature 
codes. Beyond names of places in various languages, data stored include 
latitude, longitude, elevation, population, administrative subdivision and 
postal codes. All coordinates use the WGS84 system (World Geodetic System 1984).

Those data are accessible free of charge through a number of Web services and 
a daily database export. The Web services include direct and reverse geocoding, 
finding places through postal codes, finding places next to a given place, and 
finding Wikipedia articles about neighbouring places.
