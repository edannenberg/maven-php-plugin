 <s>Object oriented interface for searching and manipulating LDAP-entries</s>
 <d>Net_LDAP2 is the successor of Net_LDAP which is a clone of Perls Net::LDAP
                object interface to directory servers. It does contain most of Net::LDAPs
                features but has some own too.
                 With Net_LDAP2 you have:
                 * A simple object-oriented interface to connections, searches entries and filters.
                 * Support for tls and ldap v3.
                 * Simple modification, deletion and creation of ldap entries.
                 * Support for schema handling.

                 Net_LDAP2 layers itself on top of PHP's existing ldap extensions.</d>

 <n>* Fixed a little issue with repetive adding the same attribute value
* Fixed Bug #14886 that caused problems with OpenLDAP and V3 only connects
* Fixed Bug #14903 and #15494, now bind attempt is also encrypted if TLS is requested
* Fixed issue with repetitve adding or deleting values causing Net_LDAP to send the same change multiple times
* Fixed Bug #15364 that caused a problem with setting the ldap version if only one version is supported by server</n>
