 <s>Show Information about your PEAR install and its packages</s>
 <d>This package generates a comprehensive information page for your current PEAR install.
The format for the page is similar to that for phpinfo() except using PEAR colors.
Has complete PEAR Credits (based on the packages you have installed).
Will show if there is a newer version than the one presently installed (and what it's state is)
Each package has an anchor in the form pkg_PackageName - where PackageName is a case-sensitive PEAR package name
