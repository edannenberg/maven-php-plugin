 <s>database abstraction layer</s>
 <d>Documentation can be found at: http://www.backendmedia.com/MDB/docs/

    PEAR MDB is a merge of the PEAR DB and Metabase php database abstraction layers.

    It provides a common API for all support RDBMS. The main difference to most other DB abstraction packages is that MDB goes much further to ensure portability. Among other things MDB features:
    * An OO-style query API
    * A DSN (data source name) or array format for specifying database servers
    * Datatype abstraction and on demand datatype conversion
    * Portable error codes
    * Sequential and non sequential row fetching as well as bulk fetching
    * Ordered array and associative array for the fetched rows
    * Prepare/execute (bind) emulation
    * Sequence emulation
    * Replace emulation
    * Limited Subselect emulation
    * Row limit support
    * Transactions support
    * Large Object support
    * Index/Unique support
    * Module Framework to load advanced functionality on demand
    * Table information interface
    * RDBMS management methods (creating, dropping, altering)
    * RDBMS independent xml based schema definition management
    * Altering of a DB from a changed xml schema
    * Reverse engineering of xml schemas from an existing DB (currently only MySQL)
    * Full integration into the PEAR Framework
    * Wrappers for the PEAR DB and Metabase APIs
    * PHPDoc API documentation

    Currently supported RDBMS:
    MySQL
    PostGreSQL
    Oracle
    Frontbase
    Querysim
    Interbase
    Firebird
    MSSQL
    Other soon to follow.
