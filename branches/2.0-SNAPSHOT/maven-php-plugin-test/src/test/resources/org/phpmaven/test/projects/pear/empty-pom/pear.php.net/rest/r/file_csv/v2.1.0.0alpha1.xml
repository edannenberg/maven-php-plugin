 <n>* Split File_CSV from File into it's own package
* Change license to New BSD
* File_CSV::unquote now takes in an array and a string (string being the old way)
  Passing in an array of fields, for example a whole line.
* Double quotes is now the default quoting character when people don't specify which quoting character to use

* Fix Bug #14118: Error with quoted fields and separators [dufuz]
* Fix Bug #11526: DiscoverFormat returns wrong nr of fields [izi]
