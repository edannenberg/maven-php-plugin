 <s>Automated word hyphenation with the TeX algorithm.</s>
 <d>This package implements the TeX hyphenation algorithm based on pattern.

The package can support various backends for pattern retrieval. At this stage only flat files with TeX pattern were implemented. The advantage of the TeX pattern is the available multi-language support. Currently german, oxford and american english are supported.

For speed purposes an interface for a cache of hyphenated words was implemented.</d>
