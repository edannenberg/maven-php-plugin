 <s>User authentication and permission management framework</s>
 <d>LiveUser is a set of classes for dealing with user authentication
  and permission management. Basically, there are three main elements that
  make up this package:

  * The LiveUser class
  * The Auth containers
  * The Perm containers

  The LiveUser class takes care of the login process and can be configured
  to use a certain permission container and one or more different auth containers.
  That means, you can have your users' data scattered amongst many data containers
  and have the LiveUser class try each defined container until the user is found.
  For example, you can have all website users who can apply for a new account online
  on the webserver's local database. Also, you want to enable all your company's
  employees to login to the site without the need to create new accounts for all of
  them. To achieve that, a second container can be defined to be used by the LiveUser class.

  You can also define a permission container of your choice that will manage the rights for
  each user. Depending on the container, you can implement any kind of permission schemes
  for your application while having one consistent API.

  Using different permission and auth containers, it's easily possible to integrate
  newly written applications with older ones that have their own ways of storing permissions
  and user data. Just make a new container type and you're ready to go!

  Currently available are containers using:
  PEAR::DB, PEAR::MDB, PEAR::MDB2, PEAR::XML_Tree and PEAR::Auth.

 <n>- typo fix getMessage =&gt; getMessage() (bug #5283)
- added parameter to unlink backup file to force new creation in installSchema()
- fixed join points in implied_rights table in the perm Globals.php
- removed unnecessary join in readUserRights() of the database containers
- removed autoInit (all init() manually instead) *BC BREAK*
- reworked log/debug handling (there is a new 'debug' conf option which can
  either be a bool or a log instance)
- made the log property public which made it possible to remove addErrorLog()
- renamed loadPEARLog() to PEARLogFactory and reworked it to return a Log
  instance as a static method
- added an optional signature parameter to singleton() instead of using the
  handle/password/confName parameters (which no longer exist) *BC BREAK*
- made login() and logout() public
- made freeze() private
- prefixed all private properties/methods with an underscore</n>
