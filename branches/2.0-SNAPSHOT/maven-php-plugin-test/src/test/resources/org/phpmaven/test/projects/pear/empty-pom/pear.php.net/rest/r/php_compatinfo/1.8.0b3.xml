 <s>Find out the minimum version and the extensions required for a piece of code to run</s>
 <d>PHP_CompatInfo will parse a file/folder/script/array to find out the minimum
version and extensions required for it to run. Features advanced debug output
which shows which functions require which version and CLI output script</d>
 <da>2008-06-07 16:18:41</da>
 <n>* changes
- parseArray() method was missing in beta2 is back
- add or remove observers is now possible with public method of the controller
  PHP_CompatInfo (main class)

* news
- CLI is back alive with the new Text Renderer
  a new switch -p | --progress was added to display a wait message or a progress bar
  (if PEAR::Console_ProgressBar is installed)

Do not forget to have a look on all examples pci180_parse* that demonstrates
the new API.

Beta 4, the last beta before RC, that is planned for june 18th will include
2 new more renderers :
- Html, for web page content
- Csv, for a plain text content

* QA
- Do no search Unit tests in this release, it is not yet ready, so I have removed
  them until beta4</n>
