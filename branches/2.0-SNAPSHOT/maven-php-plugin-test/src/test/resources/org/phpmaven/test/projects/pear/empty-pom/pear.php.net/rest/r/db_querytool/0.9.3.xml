 <s>An OO-interface for easily retreiving and modifying data in a DB.</s>
 <d>This package is an OO-abstraction to the SQL-Query language, it provides methods such
as setWhere, setOrder, setGroup, setJoin, etc. to easily build queries.
It also provides an easy to learn interface that interacts nicely with HTML-forms using
arrays that contain the column data, that shall be updated/added in a DB.
This package bases on an SQL-Builder which lets you easily build
SQL-Statements and execute them.

 <n>- new method getCol() which lets you retreive just one column
- getAll() takes an additional optional parameter, where you can define
  the method that should be used for firing the query
- update() does also consider the value of setWhere() when no primary column is given
  added a _buildUpdateQuery() for that too
- added umbrello-uml class diagram
- fixing some typos, esp. for making the useResult() work
- bugfix in update, use fully qualified table name (Uwe Dörl)
- bugfix in _buildSelectQuery, enclose column names by &quot;&quot;
  now Oracle should work and also reserved keywords can be used as column names (Uwe Dörl)
- some bugfixes and more CS issues</n>
