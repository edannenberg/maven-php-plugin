 <s>The phpDocumentor package provides automatic documenting of php api directly from the source.</s>
 <d>The phpDocumentor tool is a standalone auto-documentor similar to JavaDoc
written in PHP.  It differs from PHPDoc in that it is MUCH faster, parses a much
wider range of php files, and comes with many customizations including 11 HTML
templates, windows help file CHM output, PDF output, and XML DocBook peardoc2
output for use with documenting PEAR.  In addition, it can do PHPXref source
code highlighting and linking.

Features (short list):
-output in HTML, PDF (directly), CHM (with windows help compiler), XML DocBook
-very fast
-web and command-line interface
-fully customizable output with Smarty-based templates
-recognizes JavaDoc-style documentation with special tags customized for PHP 4
-automatic linking, class inheritance diagrams and intelligent override
-customizable source code highlighting, with phpxref-style cross-referencing
-parses standard README/CHANGELOG/INSTALL/FAQ files and includes them
 directly in documentation
-generates a todo list from @todo tags in source
-generates multiple documentation sets based on @access private, @internal and
 {@internal} tags
-example php files can be placed directly in documentation with highlighting
 and phpxref linking using the @example tag
-linking between external manual and API documentation is possible at the
 sub-section level in all output formats
-easily extended for specific documentation needs with Converter
-full documentation of every feature, manual can be generated directly from
 the source code with &quot;phpdoc -c makedocs&quot; in any format desired.
-current manual always available at http://www.phpdoc.org/manual.php
-user .ini files can be used to control output, multiple outputs can be
 generated at once

 <n>Bugfix release

From both Windows and Unix, both the command-line version
of phpDocumentor and the web interface will work
out of the box by using command phpdoc - guaranteed :)

Note: the web interface will not work out of the box in PEAR.  Unfortunately,
the file role needed to make this possible is still pending, but planned for
addition in PEAR 1.3.  If you wish to use the web interface, you must
download phpDocumentor 1.2.2 from http://www.phpdoc.org.

- WARNING: phpDocumentor installs phpdoc in the
  scripts directory, and this will conflict with PHPDoc,
  you can't have both installed at the same time
- fixed minor problems with --ignore option
- DocBook/peardoc2 converter outputs valid DocBook
- CHM:default converter outputs valid CHM file
- PDF:default converter outputs a great file
  including color source-highlighting!
- fixed Page-Level DocBlock issues, now a page-level
  docblock is the first docblock in a file if it contains
  a @package tag, UNLESS the next element is a class.  Warnings
  raised are much more informative
- removed erroneous warning of duplicate @package tag in certain cases
- fixed these bugs:
 [ 765455 ] phpdoc can't find php if it is in /usr/local/bin
 [ 767251 ] broken links when no files in default package
 [ 768947 ] Multiple vars not recognised
 [ 772441 ] nested arrays fail parser
 [ 778920 ] tutorial link warning
 [ 779552 ] &quot;Documention&quot; instead of &quot;Documentation&quot; in generated pages
 [ 780332 ] {@link} is closing the link prematurely when a ',' is found
 [ 781913 ] usedby not when @uses at class level
 [ 784810 ] stat failing.
 [ 786180 ] simple lists fail if line starts with an inline tag
 [ 788251 ] {@link function blah()} and {@link object blah} fail
 [ 788271 ] HighlightParser links to methods before classes
 [ 790685 ] HighlightParser doesn't link class::method() outside methods
 [ 791023 ] bug in output: &lt;br;&amp;nbsp;/&gt;
 [ 791030 ] old PHP version bug /t and ' becomes to &amp;quot;
 [ 791131 ] old PHP version bug in output, if define contains &quot;(&quot;
 [ 791291 ] ignoretags handling incorrectly looks for ignore-tags</n>
