 <s>The phpDocumentor package provides automatic documenting of php api directly from the source.</s>
 <d>The phpDocumentor tool is a standalone auto-documentor similar to JavaDoc
written in PHP.  It differs from PHPDoc in that it is MUCH faster, parses a much
wider range of php files, and comes with many customizations including 11 HTML
templates, windows help file CHM output, PDF output, and XML DocBook peardoc2
output for use with documenting PEAR.  In addition, it can do PHPXref source
code highlighting and linking.

Features (short list):
-output in HTML, PDF (directly), CHM (with windows help compiler), XML DocBook
-very fast
-web and command-line interface
-fully customizable output with Smarty-based templates
-recognizes JavaDoc-style documentation with special tags customized for PHP 4
-automatic linking, class inheritance diagrams and intelligent override
-customizable source code highlighting, with phpxref-style cross-referencing
-parses standard README/CHANGELOG/INSTALL/FAQ files and includes them
 directly in documentation
-generates a todo list from @todo tags in source
-generates multiple documentation sets based on @access private, @internal and
 {@internal} tags
-example php files can be placed directly in documentation with highlighting
 and phpxref linking using the @example tag
-linking between external manual and API documentation is possible at the
 sub-section level in all output formats
-easily extended for specific documentation needs with Converter
-full documentation of every feature, manual can be generated directly from
 the source code with &quot;phpdoc -c makedocs&quot; in any format desired.
-current manual always available at http://www.phpdoc.org/manual.php
-user .ini files can be used to control output, multiple outputs can be
 generated at once

 <n>Bugfix release

From both Windows and Unix, both the command-line version
of phpDocumentor and the web interface will work
out of the box by using command phpdoc - guaranteed :)

WARNING: in order to use the web interface through PEAR, you must set your
data_dir to a subdirectory of your document root.

$ pear config-set data_dir /path/to/public_html/pear

on Windows with default apache setup, it might be

C:\&gt; pear config-set data_dir &quot;C:\Program Files\Apache\htdocs\pear&quot;

After this, install/upgrade phpDocumentor

$ pear upgrade phpDocumentor

and you can browse to:

http://localhost/pear/PhpDocumentor/

for the web interface

- WARNING: phpDocumentor installs phpdoc in the
  scripts directory, and this will conflict with PHPDoc,
  you can't have both installed at the same time
- fixed these bugs:
 [ 731750 ] Links to unparsed includes shown (2nd time reopened)
 [ 771531 ] body styles not explicitly white
 [ 795095 ] top_frame.tpl doesn't output single RIC element
 [ 797066 ] HighlightParser stuffs whitespace in start of string in func
 [ 802891 ] Inline link text does not show up</n>
