 <n>* Refine the use of setDefaults and setContants.
setDefaults is used to fill the form with defaults values that will be overriden by submitted values once the form is submitted.
setConstants is used to overide default and submitted values for example if form is not valid when submitted. In this case, constant values will be shown again in the field.
In all cases, values won't be overriden by the other method anymore.
* Added grouped elements validation on the server-side.
* Added grouped elements customization through templates.
* Fixes in rules for file uploads on maxsize, mime... when element is not required.
* Added a new example for groups customization and validation.</n>
