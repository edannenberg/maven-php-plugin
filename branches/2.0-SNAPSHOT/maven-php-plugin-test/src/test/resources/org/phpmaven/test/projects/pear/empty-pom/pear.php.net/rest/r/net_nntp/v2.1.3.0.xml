 <s>NNTP implementation</s>
 <d>PEAR's package for communication with NNTP/Usenet servers.
Net_NNTP handles the connection and protocol level commands (RFC977), including many commonly implemented non-standard commands (RFC2980).
Net_NNTP includes an unserfriendly API for intermediate user, who don't want to work directly at the command level. However, Net_NNTP does require some knowlege about the NNTP protocol (RFC 977), and general knowledge about email (RFC(2)822) and MIME (2045-2048), since any handling of both content and headers is left up to the user!
The protocol implementation does not parse the actual article data, but at the command level it splits returned data at protocol specified boundaries where appropriate.</d>

 <n>+ WARNING!
  - Serious backward compatibility break with v1.2.x (alpha) releases!!! The experimental classes Net_NNTP_Header and Net_NNTP_Message has been droped, since such features does not belong in this package! For now loading either class results in a notice/warning, but later on both classes will be removed! Previously unimplementet NNTP commands now allow access to article headers...
  - Some backward compatibility break with v1.1.x (beta) releases!!!
