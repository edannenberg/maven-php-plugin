 <s>An SQL Builder, Object Interface to Database Tables</s>
 <d>DataObject performs 2 tasks:
  1. Builds SQL statements based on the objects vars and the builder methods.
  2. acts as a datastore for a table row.
  The core class is designed to be extended for each of your tables so that you put the
  data logic inside the data classes.
  included is a Generator to make your configuration files and your base classes.

Updated note about overload..

- DB_DATAOBJECT_NO_OVERLOAD, if defined, dataobjects will not be overload
  NOTE: overload causes problems in PHP4:
    - all pass and return by reference fail
    - zend optimizer may segfault
    - getDatabaseConnection() does not return real connection
      (eg. it's read only!)</n>
