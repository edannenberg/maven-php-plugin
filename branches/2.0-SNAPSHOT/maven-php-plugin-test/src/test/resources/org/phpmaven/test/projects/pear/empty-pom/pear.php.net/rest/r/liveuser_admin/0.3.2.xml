 <s>User authentication and permission management framework</s>
 <d>LiveUser_Admin is meant to be used with the LiveUser package.
  It is composed of all the classes necessary to administrate
  data used by LiveUser.
  
  You'll be able to add/edit/delete/get things like:
  * Rights
  * Users
  * Groups
  * Areas
  * Applications
  * Subgroups
  * ImpliedRights
  
  And all other entities within LiveUser.
  
  At the moment we support the following storage containers:
  * DB
  * MDB
  * MDB2
  
  But it takes no time to write up your own storage container,
  so if you like to use native mysql functions straight, then it's possible
  to do so in under a hour!

 <n>- copy storage config before passing it to the storageFactory() since this
  method messes with the values which causes the original to be modified due to
  using pass by reference
- removed old 'with' handling code that is no longer necessary from getGroups()
  in the medium container</n>
