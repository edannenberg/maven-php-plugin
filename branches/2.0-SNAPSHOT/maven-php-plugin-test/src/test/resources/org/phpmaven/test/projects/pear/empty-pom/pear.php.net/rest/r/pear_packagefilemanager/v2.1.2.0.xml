 <s>PEAR_PackageFileManager takes an existing package.xml file and updates it with a new filelist and changelog</s>
 <d>This package revolutionizes the maintenance of PEAR packages.  With a few parameters,
the entire package.xml is automatically updated with a listing of all files in a package.
Features include
 - reads in an existing package.xml file, and only changes the release/changelog
 - a plugin system for retrieving files in a directory.  Currently two plugins
   exist, one for standard recursive directory content listing, and one that
   reads the CVS/Entries files and generates a file listing based on the contents
   of a checked out CVS repository
 - incredibly flexible options for assigning install roles to files/directories
 - ability to ignore any file based on a * ? wildcard-enabled string(s)
 - ability to include only files that match a * ? wildcard-enabled string(s)
 - ability to manage dependencies
 - can output the package.xml in any directory, and read in the package.xml
   file from any directory.
 - can specify a different name for the package.xml file
 
As of version 1.2.0, PEAR_PackageFileManager is fully unit tested.

 <n>*fully* unit-tested with 2 new features: simpleoutput and addhiddenfiles

- new feature, &quot;simpleoutput&quot; option.  This eliminates output of
  md5sum and provides tags for readability, and outputs &lt;dir&gt; tags.
- each &lt;/dir&gt; close tag has a &lt;!-- comment --&gt; containing the full
  directory name that was concluded
- new feature, &quot;addhiddenfiles&quot; option.  This allows addition of
  files that begin with . like .bashrc</n>
