 <n>Made part finders truly reversable, specify a text/plain part by
default, if none is found, tries to find a text/html part instead.. and vise versa.
Still looks for a text/html part by default.  Minor API changes, $attempt
argument added to getDefaultPid and getBody methods  BC not broken, as these arguments are
used internally.
Minor improvements to CS.
Minor corrections to documentation.
MAIL_IMAP_LITERAL_DECODE option added for getBody() $action argument.
extractMIME method added, allows the user to specify a specific MIME type
to search for, method will return an associative array containing all PIDs
found for that MIME type.  PIDs can then be supplied to getBody with
$action = MAIL_IMAP_LITERAL_DECODE to retrieve specific parts.
Not much testing on this release so please report bugs!</n>
