 <s>Object oriented interface for searching and manipulating LDAP-entries</s>
 <d>Net_LDAP is a clone of Perls Net::LDAP object interface to
                 directory servers. It does contain most of Net::LDAPs features
                 but has some own too.
                 With Net_LDAP you have:
                 * A simple object-oriented interface to connections, searches entries and filters.
                 * Support for tls and ldap v3.
                 * Simple modification, deletion and creation of ldap entries.
                 * Support for schema handling.

                 Net_LDAP layers itself on top of PHP's existing ldap extensions.</d>
