 <n>Bug fix release (damn switch)
* Reimplemented switch, case and default control logic. Now, almost all the switch stamements should be managed well. Please, give feedback!
* Home Page URL changed to http://beautifyphp.sourceforge.net/
* Author email changed to cdx _at _users.sourceforge.com
- Bug fix[7759]: Adding a comment after a case statement in a switch causes the indenting to be wrong. Know issue: Line comment (//) after a case cause a extra new line if the next statement have T_CASE or T_DEFAULT token.
- Bug fix[7818]: Where curly brackets are used to indicate a variable class  property, PHP_Beautifier adds extra whitespace as if it were  parsing a class method or function.
- Feature Request [#7854]: Rewrite T_OPEN_TAG_WITH_ECHO in the default filter, specially &quot;&lt;%=&quot; because it will be removed in PHP6. Currently implemented on Pear filter</n>
