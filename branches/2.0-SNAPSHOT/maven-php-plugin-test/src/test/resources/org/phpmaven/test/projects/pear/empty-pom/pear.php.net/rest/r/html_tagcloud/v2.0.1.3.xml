 <s>Generate a &quot;Tag Cloud&quot; in HTML and visualize clickable tags by their frequenzy.
Additionally visualizes each tag's age.</s>
 <d>This package can be used to generate tag clouds. The output is HTML and CSS.

A Tag Cloud is an visual representation of list of so-called &quot;tags&quot; or keywords,
that do have a different font size depending on how often they occur on the
page/blog. A less used synonym for a Tag Cloud that came up before Web 2.0 is
the term &quot;weightet list&quot;. Popular examples of Tag Clouds and their use can be
found in action at pages like Flickr, Del.icio.us and Technorati. A nice
overview on what a Tag Cloud can actually do can be found at WikiPedia:
http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_cloud

This package does not only visualize frequency, but also timeline infomation.
The newer the tag is, the deeper its color will be; older tags will have a
lighter color.

The goal of &quot;HTML_TagCloud&quot; is to provide an easy to implement/configureable Tag
Cloud solution that is suitable for any PHP-based webapp.

Features:
 - set up each tag's name, URL, frequenzy, age
 - customizable colors
 - customizable font-sizes</d>

 <n>Quality review release
 - Heavily applied PEAR Coding Standards
 - extended unit tests

Fixed issues
 - Fixed hard-wired css class name: If cloud consists of one tag and epocLevel
   was set up by extending the class member, the default value for the css class
   may be incorrect if it was not &quot;latest&quot;. This behaviour has been changed. The
   value for the css class is now based on the last value of a _epocLevel key
   string.
 - Returned value of _buidHTMLTags was of wrong type if no tags were set up.
   This behaviour has been changed. An empty tag cloud will now be displayed
   with text &quot;not enough data&quot; instead of returning an empty string.</n>
