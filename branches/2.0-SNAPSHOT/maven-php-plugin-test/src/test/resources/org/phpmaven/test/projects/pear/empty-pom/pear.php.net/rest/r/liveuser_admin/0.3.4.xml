 <s>User authentication and permission management framework</s>
 <d>LiveUser_Admin is meant to be used with the LiveUser package.
It is composed of all the classes necessary to administrate
data used by LiveUser.

You'll be able to add/edit/delete/get things like:
* Rights
* Users
* Groups
* Areas
* Applications
* Subgroups
* ImpliedRights

And all other entities within LiveUser.

At the moment we support the following storage containers:
* DB
* MDB
* MDB2

But it takes no time to write up your own storage container,
so if you like to use native mysql functions straight, then it's possible
to do so in under a hour!

 <n>- fixed typo error in sanity checking of the SQL storage layer update() method
- fixed bug in the SQL storage layer insert() method that would lead to the
  sequence value not being returned if it was set externally. this for example
  leads to broken behaviour  in the addUser() wrapper method in LiveUser_Admin
- added error handler to example1 so that notices and warnings will not go
  unnoticed so easily in the large output</n>
