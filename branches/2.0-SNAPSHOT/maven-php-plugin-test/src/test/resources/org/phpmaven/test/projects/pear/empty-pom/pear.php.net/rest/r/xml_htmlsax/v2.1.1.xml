 <s>A SAX based parser for HTML and other badly formed XML documents</s>
 <d>XML_HTMLSax is a SAX based XML parser for badly formed XML documents, such as HTML.
  The original code base was developed by Alexander Zhukov and published at
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpshelve/, who in turn was inspired by the Python HTMLSax package.
  Alexander kindly gave permission to modify the code and license for inclusion in PEAR.
  PEAR::XML_HTMLSax takes the last release from Sourceforge (HTMLSax2002082201) and changes the API to make using HTMLSax very similar to using the native PHP Expat extension, opening it up for use with projects like SAX filters: http://phpxmlclasses.sourceforge.net/show_doc.php?class=class_sax_filters.html. This version also fixes some bugs and adds further features such as the ability to handle processing instructions and JSP/ASP markup.
