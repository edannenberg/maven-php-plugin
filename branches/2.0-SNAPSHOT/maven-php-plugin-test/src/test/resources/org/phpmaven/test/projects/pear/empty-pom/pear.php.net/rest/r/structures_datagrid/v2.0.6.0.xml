 <s>A tabular structure that contains a record set of data for paging and sorting purposes.</s>
 <d>This package offers a toolkit to render out a datagrid in HTML format as well as
many other formats such as an XML Document, an Excel Spreadsheet, an XUL Document and more.
It also offers paging and sorting functionallity to limit the data that is presented and processed.
This concept is based on the .NET Framework DataGrid control and works very well with database and XML result sets.

 <n>Initial Beta Release - Beware of many changes to the core API

********* Warning: You must now instantiate as a reference **********
 
Implemented new data source layer to handle data manipluation with many
different data source types such as DB_DataObject, CSV, XML, etc.
The DataGrid now handles the data fetching, so if you are using
DataObjects, all you need to do is bind to the dataobject with out
fetching, the DataGrid will take care of the rest.  Same with a DB_Result
object, just simply create the result object and bind it to the datagrid.

New Features:
  Automatic GET/POST/Cookie handling for sorting and paging
  Renderers: XUL, CSV, Console Table
  DataSources: DB_Result, DB_DataObject, Array, CSV, XML, RSS

Many Bugfixes included as well:
  Bug #2123: Allows to use db_dataobject extended classes
  Bug #2124: Implement formbuilder options from db_dataobject
  Bug #2125: Allow GET/POST/COOKIE varaibles for sorting to have prefixes
  Bug #2128: Better error handling for setRecord method
  Bug #2438: HTML Renderer better organized with render, toHTML, getTable
             methods.  Other renderers reflect similiar changes
  Bug #2499: Converted all ampersands to &amp;
  Bug #2501: Implemented a sorting icon indicatior for HTMLTable renderer</n>
