 <s>XML based database schema manager</s>
 <d>PEAR::MDB2_Schema enables users to maintain RDBMS independant schema
files in XML that can be used to create, alter and drop database entities
and insert data into a database. Reverse engineering database schemas from
existing databases is also supported. The format is compatible with both
PEAR::MDB and Metabase.</d>

 <n>- Primary Key is removed when updating a table against its XML (Bug #11604)
- Added support to INSERT...SELECT syntax, so it is now possible to prevent data loss when rollback an updated database (Bug #10892)
- Updated API of getInstructionFields() and getInstructionWhere()
- It is now possible to prevent updateDatabase() of overwriting the old schema file
- alterDatabaseTables() first add new tables, then remove the old one. it is necessary to save table data before a remove
- updateDatabase() was aborting, under certain conditions, when &lt;was&gt; was not found (Bug #11600)
- Now validating database definition when reverse engineering (Bug #11604)
- createDatabase() has a new parameter that is passed to the database driver to set some options like table engine
- Foreign Keys support
- It is now possible to assign to a column the value of another column, of the same table, when inserting data
- Fixed the HTML etities issue when parsing a schema file (Bug #11676)
- XML Documentation, XSD and DST updated to show/expect the attributes in a unique order. Writer and parsers was also updated to handle the attributes in that some order. That said Parser and Parser2 must have the exactly same output for a given XML
- Except for table fields, all other database elements are being initialized with all its attributes, no matter if those attributes are present on the XML or not
- Many bugs fixed in Parser2, that was not creating a valid database definition
- Introduced attribute &quot;fixed&quot; of table field declaration
- validateIndex() is now checking whether a index has fields
- Validate is not returning MDB2_OK instead of boolean true
- XML Documentation and schema validators revised and updated

open todo items:
- Clean up output of getDefinitionFromDatabase(). Sync it with Parser and Parser2.
- Automatically load reserved keywords
- Make MDB2_Schema loadable via MDB2_Driver_Common::loadModule() (Bug #8270)
- Allow simple if statements that mean that anything enclosed is only executed
  if it meets certain criterias based on that version number (or some other
  variable). This would enable people to add DML statements that are only
  executed when updating from a specific version.
- Modularize Writer code or remake it
- Add specific error codes for Validate class
- Add support for ORDER clauses on UPDATEs (to resolve the duplicate key 
  problem)
- Update description.schema.xml
- Create unit test for comparedefinitions()
- Create unit test for initializetable()
- Create unit test to compare the expected array definition with what is parsed
- Improve validateDataFieldValue() to validate &lt;column&gt;
- Provide more info on MDB2_Schema_Validate errors (output parsed value and expected value)
- Views support
- Fulltext index support</n>
