 <s>Integrated Templates</s>
 <d>HTML_Template_IT:
Simple template API.
The Isotemplate API is somewhat tricky for a beginner although it is the best
one you can build. template::parse() [phplib template = Isotemplate] requests
you to name a source and a target where the current block gets parsed into.
Source and target can be block names or even handler names. This API gives you
a maximum of fexibility but you always have to know what you do which is
quite unusual for php skripter like me.

I noticed that I do not any control on which block gets parsed into which one.
If all blocks are within one file, the script knows how they are nested and in
which way you have to parse them. IT knows that inner1 is a child of block2, there's
no need to tell him about this.
Features :
  * Nested blocks
  * Include external file
  * Custom tags format (default {mytag})

HTML_Template_ITX :
With this class you get the full power of the phplib template class.
You may have one file with blocks in it but you have as well one main file
and multiple files one for each block. This is quite usefull when you have
user configurable websites. Using blocks not in the main template allows
you to modify some parts of your layout easily.</d>

 <n>- Add support for pear package 2.0 format
- Remove support for pear package 1.0 format
- Fix bug #9501, doller signs disapear if preg_match is used.
- Fix bug #9783, don't remove variable which values follow the variable pattern
  To allow backwards compatbility an option preserve_input is added.
  If it is false, the old behaviour will be used and therefore those values will be deleted.
  Default is true, so new behaviour.
- Fix bug #9853, problems with dots in placeholders or blocknames    
- Add option 'preserve_input' to only remove unkown variable that were present during setTemplate or lodaTemplatefile
  which is the behaviour before 1.3.0a1
- Fix bug #13935 - docblock is wrong
- Improved PHPCS (Request #15039)</n>
