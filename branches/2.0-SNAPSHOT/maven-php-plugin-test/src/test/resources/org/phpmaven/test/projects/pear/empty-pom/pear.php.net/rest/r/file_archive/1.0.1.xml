 <s>File_Archive will let you manipulate easily the tar, gz, bz2 and zip files</s>
 <d>This library is strongly object oriented. It makes it very easy to use, writing simple code, yet the library is very powerfull.
File_Archive is made of two objects : readers and writers. Are currently implemented readers from file, directory, tar, gz, zip and bzip2 archives.
You can write to file(s), send mails with files attached, or create tar, gz, zip, bzip2 archives.

 <n>+ Bug 4192 (&lt;? instead of &lt;?php in some source files)
+ Functions File_Archive::isKnownExtension and File_Archive:;readArchive
  added. They allow to specify the type of an archive. This is usefull is the extension
  of the file doesn't reflect its real type.</n>
