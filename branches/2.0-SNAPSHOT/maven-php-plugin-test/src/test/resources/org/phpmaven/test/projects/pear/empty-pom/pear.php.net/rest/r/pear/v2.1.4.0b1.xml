 <n>This is a major milestone release for PEAR.  In addition to several killer features,
  every single element of PEAR has a regression test, and so stability is much higher
  than any previous PEAR release, even with the beta label.

  New features in a nutshell:
  * full support for channels
  * pre-download dependency validation
  * new package.xml 2.0 format allows tremendous flexibility while maintaining BC
  * support for optional dependency groups and limited support for sub-packaging
  * robust dependency support
  * full dependency validation on uninstall
  * remote install for hosts with only ftp access - no more problems with
    restricted host installation
  * full support for mirroring
  * support for bundling several packages into a single tarball
  * support for static dependencies on a uri-based package
  * support for custom file roles and installation tasks

  Specific changes from 1.4.0a12:
  * remove old notes (prior to 1.4.0a11)
  * implement conflicts tags for frontend packages
  * implement separation of PEAR_RemoteInstall package
  * add default install for PEAR_Delegator package (if installing via PEAR 1.4.0 only)
  * fix PEAR_PackageFile_v2_rw::setSourcePackage() to match newer package.xml 2.0 format
  * fix PEAR_Common::validatePackageInfo() so it accepts the contents of a package.xml
  * implement Feature #4464: ability to modify a post-install script prompt at runtime
  * fix Bug #4741: Newest Pager won't install (no upgrade available)
  * fix Bug #4817: Fix warning with corrupt cache
  * fix Bug #4818: References fix
  * fix Bug #4825: pear behind a proxy using REST dosnt work
  * fix Bug #4952: PEAR_Exception::toHTML() spits notices
  * fix Bug #5073: cache fatal error if no cached content
  * fix Bug #5131: pear info PEAR shows &quot;Array&quot; with installed PEAR 1.4.0a13 (CVS)
  * fix Bug #5132: pear info Blah.tgz reports optional deps as required
  * fix Bug #5135: pear info PEAR has notice with a13 installed</n>
