 <s>OO interface for searching and manipulating LDAP-entries</s>
 <d>Net Ldap is a clone of Perls Net::LDAP object interface to
                 ldapservers. It does not contain all of Net::LDAPs features,
                 but has:
                 * A simple OO-interface to connections, searches entries and filters.
                 * Support for tls and ldap v3.
                 * Simple modification, deletion and creation of ldapentries.
                 * Support for schema handling.

                 Net_LDAP layers itself on top of PHP's existing ldap extensions.</d>

 <n>This release features some internal code movements to be more compatible to PERL::Net_LDAP.
           The movements include:
              * Removed UTF8 en-/decoding stuff from Net_LDAP_Utils class since this was moved to Net_LDAP class in 0.6.6
              * Moved Filter encoding from Net_LDAP_Filter to Net_LDAP_Util
              * Moved ldap_explode_dn_escaped() from Net_LDAP_Entry to Net_LDAP_Util
              * Added perls functions from Net_LDAP::Util to our Util class, but they still need some work
           Please note that ldap_explode_dn_escaped() is not available from Net_LDAP_Entry anymore.

           Additionally some new functionality has been introduced:
              * You can now apply regular expressions directly to a entrys attributes
                and don't need to fetch the attribute values manually.
              * Net_LDAP_Schema can check if a attributes syntax is binary

           The following bugs have been resolved:
              * Connections to LDAP servers that forbid anonymous binds are possible again
              * The JPEG attribute is now properly returned as binary value instead of string
              * If the array describing selected attributes in searches didn't contain consecutive keys, there was a problem sometimes
              * Some PHP5 return issues</n>
