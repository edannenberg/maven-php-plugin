 <s>Creates XML data from SQL queries</s>
 <d>XML_Query2XML allows you to transform the records retrieved
with one or more SQL SELECT queries into XML data. Very simple to
highly complex transformations are supported. Is was written with
performance in mind and can handle large amounts of data. No XSLT needed!
Major features:
1. XML_Query2XML works with the classes provided by PHP5's DOM XML extension
2. minimum effort necessary to get the simple jobs done
3. highly configurable for more complex tasks
4. ISO/IEC 9075-14:2005 support: mapping of SQL identifiers to XML names
5. works with any database that is supported by PEAR DB, PEAR MDB2 or ADOdb
6. debugging and logging features
7. provides profiling features
8. in-depth documentation: tutorials and API documentation
9. Eight case studies: from very simple to highly complex scenarios
10. 378 unit tests for PHPUnit2

 <n>This release adds support for ADOdb (adodb.sf.net).
ADOdb can be used with different error handling mechanisms:
- default: methods return false on failure; these errors
  will be caught by XML_Query2XML and an XML_Query2XML_DBException
  will be thrown
- PEAR_Error: methods return PEAR_Error on failure (or false
  and require ADODB_Pear_Error() to be called);
  XML_Query2XML will catch these errors and throw an
  XML_Query2XML_DBException that contains the information provided
  by the PEAR_Error instance.
- exceptions: if an ADODB_Exception is thrown by ADOdb
  XML_Query2XML will catch it and throw an XML_Query2XML_DBException

This means that no matter which error handling mechanism is used within
ADOdb, XML_Query2XML will behave the same. It will throw an
XML_Query2XML_DBException in case of a database error.</n>
