 <s>User authentication and permission management framework</s>
 <d>LiveUser is a set of classes for dealing with user authentication
  and permission management. Basically, there are three main elements that
  make up this package:

  * The LiveUser class
  * The Auth containers
  * The Perm containers

  The LiveUser class takes care of the login process and can be configured
  to use a certain permission container and one or more different auth containers.
  That means, you can have your users' data scattered amongst many data containers
  and have the LiveUser class try each defined container until the user is found.
  For example, you can have all website users who can apply for a new account online
  on the webserver's local database. Also, you want to enable all your company's
  employees to login to the site without the need to create new accounts for all of
  them. To achieve that, a second container can be defined to be used by the LiveUser class.

  You can also define a permission container of your choice that will manage the rights for
  each user. Depending on the container, you can implement any kind of permission schemes
  for your application while having one consistent API.

  Using different permission and auth containers, it's easily possible to integrate
  newly written applications with older ones that have their own ways of storing permissions
  and user data. Just make a new container type and you're ready to go!

  Currently available are containers using:
  PEAR::DB, PEAR::MDB, PEAR::MDB2, PECL::PDO, PEAR::XML_Tree, PEAR::Auth, Session.

 <n>- wrong use of pdo fetch method, when no result could be fetched it returns
  false with no error. Swith to using fetchAll and check for an empty array
- we cannot decrypt most of the encryption method used by the hash extension so
  we default to returning the unmodified string
- the wrong variable was used to report the type of permission container when an
  error occured
- push an error on the stack when the encryption method cannot be found
- make sequence columns primary key
- properly disconnect the pdo object
- make it possible to set the status message mapping
- register options for create (Bug #7704)
- use the hash extension if it is present for the password encryption
- refactored decryptPW() and encryptPW() into static methods in the LiveUser class
- force null instead of false for PDO fetch() calls that return empty sets
- fixed logging into example1
- debug =&gt; false in conf doesn't work (Bug #7564; thx to Matthias)
- added support for user defined handle fields
  in DB, MDB, MDB2 and PDO containers you can set a list of fields in your auth
  container storage config, default is 'handle', example:
  'handles' =&gt; array('handle', 'auth_user_id', 'email')
  these fields are now used to find the right user on login (Request #7781)
- fixed LiveUser::decryptPW(): added missing third parameter 'secret'
- check if safe_mode is enabled in fileExists() to determine what algo to use (Bug #8296)</n>
