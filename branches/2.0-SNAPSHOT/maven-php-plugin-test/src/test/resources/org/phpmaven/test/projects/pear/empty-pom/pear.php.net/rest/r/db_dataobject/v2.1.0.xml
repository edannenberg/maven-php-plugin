 <s>An SQL Builder, Object Interface to Database Tables</s>
 <d>DataObject performs 2 tasks:
  1. Builds SQL statements based on the objects vars and the builder methods.
  2. acts as a datastore for a table row.
  The core class is designed to be extended for each of your tables so that you put the 
  data logic inside the data classes.
  included is a Generator to make your configuration files and your base classes.

 <n>- Gold 1.0 Release.. - final stable release in this series. Future versions 
  (eg. 1.1.*(dev)-&gt;1.2.*(release)) series will be generally API compatible, 
  however is likely to use MDB rather than DB.
- fix bug #23983 - argument checking on whereAdd, orderBy, limit and a few others
  (Mike Carter)
- fix bug with cache clearing not working with staticGet and update/insert
- null comparison for $object-&gt;var = 'null' will generate IS NULL query
- null insert/update  works when using 'null' as a value.
- getLinks returns true on success
- getLinks now has a formatter eg. '_%s' is default to allow user to define the
  format of variables to assign child objects to.
- generator uses UNIQUE only if no primary/autoincrement type field is found.
- added support for $object-&gt;having('sum(value) &gt; 10');
- fetch will remove some query lines (so if you want to see how the query was built
  you will have to print_r() the object after find(), and before fetch(), or just use
  debugLevel(1)
- overload calls from setFrom and toArray do method checks, as overload is still proving to
  be a little unstable especially with Zend Encoder. (Note: if DataObjects causes crashes 
  , remove the overload code at the bottom of DataObjects.php)</n>
