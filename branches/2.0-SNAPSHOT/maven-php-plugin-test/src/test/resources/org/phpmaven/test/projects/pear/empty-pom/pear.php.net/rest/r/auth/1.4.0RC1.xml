 <s>Creating an authentication system.</s>
 <d>The PEAR::Auth package provides methods for creating an authentication
system using PHP.

Currently it supports the following storage containers to read/write
the login data:

* All databases supported by the PEAR database layer
* All databases supported by the MDB database layer
* All databases supported by the MDB2 database layer
* Plaintext files
* LDAP servers
* POP3 servers
* IMAP servers
* vpopmail accounts
* RADIUS
* SAMBA password files
* SOAP (Using either PEAR SOAP package or PHP5 SOAP extension)
* PEAR website
* Kerberos V servers
* SAP servers</d>
 <da>2006-09-10 23:39:40</da>
 <n>* Added new SOAP container that makes use of the PHP5 SOAP Client. Thanks to
  Marcel Oelke &lt;puRe at rednoize dot com&gt;. Fixes #2612.
* Added support for trying all the user accounts returned from an LDAP server
  not just the first one so as to support authenticating against Lotus Notes
  which allows identical usernames where the only difference is the password.
  Fixes #5365.
* Added new Array container for simple authentication setups where it's easier
  to list users in the file than setup some sort of backend. Thanks to 
  georg_1 at have2 dot com. Fixes #5832.
* Added KADM5 container that makes use of the PECL kadm5 extension to 
  authenticate against Kerberos 5 servers. Thanks to Andrew Teixeira 
  &lt;ateixeira at gmail dot com&gt;. Fixes #6671.
* Fixed #8597. Remove references to $GLOBALS['HTTP_*_VARS'] now that we require
  PHP 4.3.3+ for other reasons.
* Added SAP container that makes use of the SAPRFC extension available from
  http://saprfc.sourceforge.net/. Thanks to Stoyan Stefanov &lt;ssttoo at gmail dot com&gt;.
  Fixes #8637.
* Fix #8599. Allow identifier quoting in DB, DBLite, MDB and MDB2 backends to 
  be switched off by developer.</n>
