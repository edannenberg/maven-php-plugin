 <s>Provides a c-client backend for webmail.</s>
 <d>Mail_IMAP provides a simplified backend for working with the c-client (IMAP) extension. It serves as an OO wrapper for commonly used c-client functions. It provides structure and header parsing as well as body retrieval.
Mail_IMAP provides a simple inbox example that demonstrates its ability to parse and view simple and multipart email messages.
Mail_IMAP also provides a connection wizard to determine the correct protocol and port settings for a remote mail server, all you need to provide is a server, a username and a password.
Mail_IMAP may be used as a webmail backend or as a component in a mailing list manager.
This package requires the c-client extension.  To download the latest version of the c-client extension goto: http://www.php.net/imap.

 <n>Bug #1350 multipart/related messages containing attachments not parsed correctly.
    - Adjusted Mail_IMAP::_scanMultipart, Mail_IMAP::getDefaultPid,
    Mail_IMAP::_checkIfParsed, added Mail_IMAP::_isMultipartRelated,
    $defaultPid member variable (this is to cut back on calls to
    Mail_IMAP::getDefaultPid).
Added debug functions. Debug functions can be called automatically if
using a URI abstraction.
Fallback pids added for Mail_IMAP::getBody, Mail_IMAP::getRawHeaders,
Mail_IMAP::getHeaders. Mail_IMAP::getBody will fallback on pid = '1'
or the first message part.  Mail_IMAP::getRawHeaders and
Mail_IMAP::getHeaders will fallback on pid = '0', or the top-level
headers.
$option member variable added, replaces and deprecates various $options
arguments used in the various methods (All of these will be removed in 2.0.0).
Mail_IMAP::setOptions method added to set-up some default usages of optional
arguments.
Mail_IMAP::getRawHeaders now returns the headers by default and has a new
$rtn argument that toggles between returning the headers and not returning
them.
Mail_IMAP::getHeaders now returns the header array (no toggle here).
Expanded embedded docs.
Added $error_reporting argument to the constructor, this is used to
determine where hacks are being used which is useful for debugging.
Error text made more consistent.
Net_URL made an optional dependancy.
messageCount, removed call to imap_errors.
Added $this-&gt;mailboxInfo['host'] and Mail_IMAP::getMailboxes() which
wraps imap_list.
Fixed leading slash making its way into $this-&gt;mailboxInfo['folder'].
Mail_IMAP::getQuota now falls back on $this-&gt;mailboxInfo['folder'], if
a connection URI is used, uses 'INBOX' if no value is passed by argument
or no value is present for $this-&gt;mailboxInfo['folder'].</n>
