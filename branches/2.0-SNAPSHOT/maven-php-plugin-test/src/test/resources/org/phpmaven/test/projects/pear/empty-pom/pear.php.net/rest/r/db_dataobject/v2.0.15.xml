 <s>An SQL Builder, Object Interface to Database Tables</s>
 <d>DataObject performs 2 tasks:
  1. Builds SQL statements based on the objects vars and the builder methods.
  2. acts as a datastore for a table row.
  The core class is designed to be extended for each of your tables so that you put the 
  data logic inside the data classes.
  included is a Generator to make your configuration files and your base classes.

 <n>- modified find(true), so that it calls fetch rather than fetchrow
  so that overriding fetch will affect get() calls.
  (probably depreciates fetchrow now .. shout if anyone is using it)
- added escape method as a quasi quote wrapper into pear::DB - useful for
  building your own queries - eg. like requests.. (does not add quotes)
- fixed bug with delete not using primary key if it was set. (Ian Eure)</n>
