 <s>Berkely-style Database Class</s>

 <n>Initial release. Like many things, the documentation is not totally
completed and expect some changes/additions to the API as I try
building some sample applications with this, discovering what works
and what doesn't. See the test files for hints on usage; the most
useful bit currently is DBA_Relational, which provides a simple
data management system. It uses DBA_Table which uses DBA. They build
on each other, but can be used individually.
See empSchema and hatSchema for examples of how to create table
schemas. See test_relational.php and test_table.php for examples of
how to formulate queries. See benchmark_drivers.php for a method of
determining the performance of various DBA drivers for your system.</n>
