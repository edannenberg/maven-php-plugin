 <s>Parse, modify, and create MARC records</s>
 <d>The standard for machine-readable cataloging (MARC) records
 is documented at http://loc.gov/marc/. This package enables you to read
 existing MARC records from a file, string, or (using the YAZ extension), from
 a Z39.50 source. You can also use this package to create new MARC records.

 This package is based on the PHP MARC package, originally called
 &quot;php-marc&quot;, that is part of the Emilda Project (http://www.emilda.org). 
 Christoffer Landtman generously agreed to make the &quot;php-marc&quot; code available
 under the GNU LGPL so it could be used as the basis of this PEAR package.</d>

 <n>0.2.0-beta
* Don't throw exceptions while parsing MARC data, because MARC data quality is uniformly bad; just add parsing errors to a warnings array on the MARC record
* Fix some documentation errors (thanks to Mark Jordan @ SFU for pointing these out)
* Add a test for setIndicator() and for escaping data in toXML()</n>
