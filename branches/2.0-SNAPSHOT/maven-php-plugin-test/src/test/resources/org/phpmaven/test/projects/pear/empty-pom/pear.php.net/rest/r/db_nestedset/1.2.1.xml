 <s>API to build and query nested sets</s>
 <d>DB_NestedSet let's you create trees with infinite depth
inside a relational database.
The package provides a way to
o create/update/delete nodes
o query nodes, trees and subtrees
o copy (clone) nodes, trees and subtrees
o move nodes, trees and subtrees
o call event handlers on specific events like
  on node deletion
o output the tree with 
  - PEAR::HTML_TreeMenu
  - TigraMenu (http://www.softcomplex.com/products/tigra_menu/)
o It also features caching of SQL queries using PEAR::Cache
</d>

 <n>- NEW FEATURES
o Now $NeSe-&gt;setAttr() allows a PEAR function cache object to be passed using
  $NeSe-&gt;setAttr(array('cache'=&gt;$cache_object));
  if this object is set, the class will use it to cache database queries.
  It will also flush this cache if the structure changes.
o All tree query methods now support an additional array named $addSQL.
  This can be used to pass additional params to a query.
  Means: You may now use joins to other tables.
  
- FIXES
o createRightNode() returned the node object instead of the new node id, which
  caused problems whith some internal method calls.
o TreeMenu and TigraMenu output drivers contained a bug which made them not
  create the whole tree under certain circumstances
  Thanks to Alain Petignat for reporting this
o Some minor E_ALL fixes (The package shouldn't produce notices/warnings with
  E_ALL set)
o Added TigraMenu.php to the package which was missing in the last release</n>
