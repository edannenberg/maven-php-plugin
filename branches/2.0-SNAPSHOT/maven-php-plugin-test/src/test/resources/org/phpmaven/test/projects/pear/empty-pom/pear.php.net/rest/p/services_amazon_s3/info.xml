 2. Create, read and delete objects including metadata.
 3. List keys in a bucket using an SPL Iterator with support for     paging, key prefixes and delimiters.
 4. Manipulate access control lists for buckets and objects.
 5. Specify the request style (virtualhost, cname, path style) and     endpoint.
 6. Get signed URLs to allow a trusted third party to access private     files.
 7. Access buckets and objects using PHP filesystem functions through     a stream wrapper</d>
