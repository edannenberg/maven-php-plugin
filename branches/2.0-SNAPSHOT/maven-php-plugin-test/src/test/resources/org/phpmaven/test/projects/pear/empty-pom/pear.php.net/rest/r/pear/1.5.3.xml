 <s>PEAR Base System</s>
 <d>The PEAR package contains:
 * the PEAR installer, for creating, distributing
   and installing packages
 * the PEAR_Exception PHP5 error handling mechanism
 * the PEAR_ErrorStack advanced error handling mechanism
 * the PEAR_Error error handling mechanism
 * the OS_Guess class for retrieving info about the OS
   where PHP is running on
 * the System class for quick handling of common operations
   with files and directories
 * the PEAR base class

  New features in a nutshell:
  * full support for channels
  * pre-download dependency validation
  * new package.xml 2.0 format allows tremendous flexibility while maintaining BC
  * support for optional dependency groups and limited support for sub-packaging
  * robust dependency support
  * full dependency validation on uninstall
  * remote install for hosts with only ftp access - no more problems with
    restricted host installation
  * full support for mirroring
  * support for bundling several packages into a single tarball
  * support for static dependencies on a url-based package
  * support for custom file roles and installation tasks

  NOTE: users of PEAR_Frontend_Web/PEAR_Frontend_Gtk must upgrade their installations
  to the latest version, or PEAR will not upgrade properly</d>
