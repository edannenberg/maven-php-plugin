 <n>- Fixed #2576: calling HTML_QuickForm::getSubmitValue() on a group 
  of radio elements caused an infinite loop with PHP eventually 
  dying of memory exhaustion. This was introduced in 3.2.4 in a 
  fix for bug #2517, those upgrading from earlier releases should 
  skip 3.2.4, those running 3.2.4 should upgrade ASAP.

- Fixed #2571: selects after the second were not correctly 
  populated in hierselect with 3 or more elements.</n>
