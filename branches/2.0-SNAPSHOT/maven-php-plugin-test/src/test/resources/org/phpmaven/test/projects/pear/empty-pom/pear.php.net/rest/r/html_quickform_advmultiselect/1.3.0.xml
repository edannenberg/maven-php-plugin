 <n>* warning
- PHP 4.2.0 is still enough to use all other API except getElementJs()
  that requires now PHP 4.3.0 to retrieve inline javascript source code.
  BTW usage of getElementJs() begin optional and not recommanded.
- To avoid BC break, and keep previous implementation still running,
 {javascript} placeholder is again included inside default template.
  Do not use it anymore. See FAQ howto section of user guide.
