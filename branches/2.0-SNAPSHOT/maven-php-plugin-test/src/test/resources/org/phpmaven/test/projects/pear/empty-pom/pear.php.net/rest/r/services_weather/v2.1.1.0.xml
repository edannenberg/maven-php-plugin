 <s>This class acts as an interface to various online weather-services.</s>
 <d>Services_Weather searches for given locations and retrieves current
weather data and, dependent on the used service, also forecasts. Up to
now, GlobalWeather from CapeScience, a XML service from weather.com
and METAR from noaa.gov are supported. Further services will get
included, if they become available, have a usable API and are properly
documented.
