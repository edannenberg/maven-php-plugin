 <s>Find out the minimum version and the extensions required for a piece of code to run</s>
 <d>PHP_CompatInfo will parse a file/folder/script/array to find out the minimum
version and extensions required for it to run. Features advanced debug output
which shows which functions require which version and CLI output script</d>
 <da>2008-06-18 17:24:29</da>
 <n>* changes
- Text Renderer: support output-level 16 (display filter on version)
- Xml  Renderer: support all output-level, verbose 4+ or debug mode
- CLI: default output-level is now 31 (still all details, as before with 15)
       since version may be hide (level 16)

* news
- 2 more renderers: Html and Csv
- 3 more examples:
  pci180_parsedir_tohtml
    = how to use your own html renderer (site web layout integration)
  pci180_parsefolder_tohtml
    = parse a huge folder and wait result with a progress bar
  pci180_parsestring_toxml
    = parse an array of string and debug it with an observer

Do not forget to have a look on all examples pci180_parse* that demonstrates
the new API.
