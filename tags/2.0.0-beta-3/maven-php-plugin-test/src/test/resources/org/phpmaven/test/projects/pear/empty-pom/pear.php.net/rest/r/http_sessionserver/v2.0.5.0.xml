 <s>Daemon to store session data that can be accessed via a simple protocol.</s>
 <d>HTTP_SessionServer is a simple PHP based daemon that helps you maintaining state between physically different hosts.
HTTP_SessionServer implements a very simple protocol to store and retrieve data on the server. The storage backend is driver based and supports your local filesystem as well as PEAR::DB as a container.
HTTP_SessionServer comes with a matching client implementation using Net_Socket as well as a session save handler.
