 <s>Preferences management class</s>
 <d>Preference Manager is a class to handle user preferences in a web application, looking them up in a table
using a combination of their userid, and the preference name to get a value, and (optionally) returning
a default value for the preference if no value could be found for that user.

It is designed to be used alongside the PEAR Auth class, but can be used with anything that allows you
to obtain the user's id - including your own code.

 <n>Added support for serializing values before they're saved in the database, and then unserializing when retrieved.
To use it set the &quot;serialize&quot; option to true.</n>
