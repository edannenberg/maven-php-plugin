 <s>Database Abstraction Layer</s>
 <d>DB is a database abstraction layer providing:
* an OO-style query API
* a DSN (data source name) format for specifying
   database servers
* prepare/execute (bind) emulation for databases
   that don't support it natively
* a result object for each query response
* portable error codes
* sequence emulation
* sequential and non-sequential row fetching as well
   as bulk fetching
* ordered array, associative array and object formats
   supported for the fetched rows
* row limit support
* transactions support
* table information interface
* DocBook and PHPDoc API documentation
* Compatible with PHP 4 and PHP 5

DB layers itself on top of PHP's existing database
extensions.  The currently supported extensions are:
dbase, fbsql, interbase, informix, msql, mssql, mysql,
mysqli, oci8, odbc, pgsql, sqlite and sybase (DB style
interfaces to LDAP servers and MS ADO (using COM) are
also avaible from a separate package).

 <n>=============
GENERAL:

Loads of small code optimizations implemented, many of
which were found using Zend Studio's Code Analyzer.

Since most DBMS's need 1/0 for boolean support, use
1/0 in common.php and only put quoteSimple() methods
in the few drivers that use true booleans or other
formats (dbase, fbase, pgsql).

Enhanced 15quote.phpt so it tests boolean features
in quoteSmart() and handles more DBMS types.

Added new 18get.phpt test.


=============
BUGS FIXED:

- odbc:
Fix connect() so uses 'database' from DSN instead of
having to use 'hostspec' as a workaround.  Correct
DSN syntax is: odbc(db2)://user:password@/database

- pgsql:
Refine DB_ERROR_NOSUCHTABLE error_regexp.

- sqlite:
Make freeResult() do what it says it does.

- ibase, msql, odbc:
quoteSmart() now uses 1/0 for booleans.

- ibase, msql, odbc:
getSpecialQuery() doesn't return anything in these
drivers. Put one in common.php that raises
DB_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED.

- mysql, mysql4:
Removed unused argument &quot;$subject&quot; from modifyQuery().</n>
