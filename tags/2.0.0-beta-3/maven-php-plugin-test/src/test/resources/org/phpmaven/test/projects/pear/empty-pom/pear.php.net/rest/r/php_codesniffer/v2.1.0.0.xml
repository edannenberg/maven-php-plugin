 <s>PHP_CodeSniffer tokenises PHP code and detects violations of a defined set of coding standards.</s>
 <d>PHP_CodeSniffer is a PHP5 script that tokenises and &quot;sniffs&quot; PHP code to detect violations of a defined set of coding standards. It is an essential development tool that ensures that your code remains clean and consistent. It can even help prevent some common semantic errors made by developers.</d>

 <n>- You can now specify the full path to a coding standard on the command line (feature request #11886)
  -- This allows you to use standards that are stored outside of PHP_CodeSniffer's own Standard dir
  -- You can also specify full paths in the CodingStandard.php include and exclude methods
  -- Classes, dirs and files need to be names as if the standard was part of PHP_CodeSniffer
  -- Thanks to Dirk Thomas for the doc generator patch and testing
- Modified the scope map to keep checking after 3 lines for some tokens (feature request #12561)
  -- Those tokens that must have an opener (like T_CLASS) now keep looking until EOF
  -- Other tokens (like T_FUNCTION) still stop after 3 lines for performance
- You can now esacpe commas in ignore patterns so they can be matched in file names
  -- Thanks to Carsten Wiedmann for the patch
- Config data is now cached in a global var so the file system is not hit so often
  -- You can also set config data temporarily for the script if you are using your own external script
  -- Pass TRUE as the third argument to PHP_CodeSniffer::setConfigData()
- PEAR ClassDeclarationSniff no longer throws errors for multi-line class declarations
- Squiz ClassDeclarationSniff now ensures there is one blank line after a class closing brace
- Squiz ClassDeclarationSniff now throws errors for a missing end PHP tag after the end class tag
- Squiz IncrementDecrementUsageSniff no longer throws errors when -= and += are being used with vars
- Squiz SwitchDeclarationSniff now throws errors for switch statements that do not contain a case statement
  -- Thanks to Sertan Danis for the patch
- MySource IncludeSystemSniff no longer throws errors for the Util package
- Fixed bug #12621 : &quot;space after AS&quot; check is wrong
  -- Thanks to Satoshi Oikawa for the patch
- Fixed bug #12645 : error message is wrong
  -- Thanks to Renoiv for the patch
- Fixed bug #12651 : Increment/Decrement Operators Usage at -1</n>
