 <n>* New additions
- Added a new hierselect element, a group of two selects where the first select changes the options of the second select using javascript (Bertrand Mansion)
- Added exportValue() and exportValues() methods, these should now be the preferred way to get form values (Alexey Borzov)
- Added addFormRule() method, this adds the rule that validates the whole form (Alexey Borzov)
- Added Italian date/dategroup names (Marco Piarulli)
- Added Slovak date/dategroup names (Peter Sablica)
- Added Icelandic date/dategroup names (Birgir Stefansson)

* Changes
- Rule-registering functions can now be called statically (Alexey Borzov)
- File-related rules and methods are moved to HTML_QuickForm_file (Alexey Borzov)
- Moved 'magic quotes' handling to QuickForm's constructor (Alexey Borzov)
- Use strtr() instead of rawurlencode() for javascript messages (Bertrand Mansion)
- Changed the nonzero rule to every numbers (negative or positive) except zero (David Sklar)
- Date element has been entirely reworked and optimised (Alexey Borzov)
- Updated the examples to use the latest changes (Alexey Borzov, Bertrand Mansion)

* Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug in HTML_QuickForm_group::getFrozenHtml() (Alexey Borzov, Wolfram Kriesing)
- Fixed a problem in HTML_QuickForm_group::getValue(): value was not changed to array (Alexey Borzov)
- Correctly set element's index in addElement() if some of the elements were previously removed (Alexey Borzov, Wolfram Kriesing)
- Fixed notice in _findElementValue() for files (Bertrand Mansion)
- Fixed passing a 'selected' attribute to addOption() (Alexey Borzov, Wolfram Kriesing)

* Deprecated
- setFormat(), setMinYear() and other accessors in date element are now deprecated. Set options and attributes in the constructor instead (Alexey Borzov)
- Method getAttributesString() is deprecated (Alexey Borzov)
- HTML_QuickForm's isUploadedFile(), moveUploadedFile(), getUploadeFile() are now deprecated (Alexey Borzov)

Deprecated methods will be removed from QuickForm in the next release.
In this release, they throw PEAR errors but still finish the job.
Use this to catch them with an error handler function, the global error code is QUICKFORM_DEPRECATED.</n>
