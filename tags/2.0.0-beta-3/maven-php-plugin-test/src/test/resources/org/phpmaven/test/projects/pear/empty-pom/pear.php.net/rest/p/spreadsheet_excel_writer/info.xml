 <s>Package for generating Excel spreadsheets</s>
 <d>Spreadsheet_Excel_Writer was born as a porting of the Spreadsheet::WriteExcel Perl module to PHP.
  It allows writing of Excel spreadsheets without the need for COM objects.
  It supports formulas, images (BMP) and all kinds of formatting for text and cells.
  It currently supports the BIFF5 format (Excel 5.0), so functionality appeared in the latest Excel versions is not yet available.</d>
