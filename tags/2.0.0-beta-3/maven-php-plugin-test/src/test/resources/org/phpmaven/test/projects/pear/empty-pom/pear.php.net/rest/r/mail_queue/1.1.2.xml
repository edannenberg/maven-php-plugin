 <s>Class for put mails in queue and send them later in background.</s>
 <d>Class to handle mail queue managment.
Wrapper for PEAR::Mail and PEAR::DB (or PEAR::MDB/MDB2).
It can load, save and send saved mails in background
and also backup some mails.

The Mail_Queue class puts mails in a temporary container,
waiting to be fed to the MTA (Mail Transport Agent),
and sends them later (e.g. a certain amount of mails
every few minutes) by crontab or in other way.

 <n>- Use PHP's date() function instead of a mysql-specific
  NOW() call in the DB container
- Added pgsql schema in the /docs/ dir (thanks Alan Knowles)
- Fixed integer quoting in the DB container (bug #1917) (thanks Alan Knowles)
- DB error reporting now uses toString() (bug #1918) (thanks Alan Knowles)</n>
