 <s>Berkely-style Database Class</s>
 <d>Implements a DBM-style database using either PHP's DBA functions or a simple DBM class written in PHP. Also provides a relational database system with support for selects, joins, sorts, projects, multiple tables, type checking, autoincrements and more. Rudimentary support for SQL 'CREATE' and 'INSERT' statements is included.

 <n>This is a fairly stable release as far as the core DBA package is concerned
(DBA_Relational and its dependencies). The rest of the package, i.e. the SQL
stuff, is going to change quite a bit after this release. Many of the
C-ism's such as token constants will go away and the routines will be similar
in functionality, though different in implementation, to perl's SQL-Statement
http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/J/JZ/JZUCKER/. Thanks to Jacob for pointing
this out.
  Changes to this release include:
    * select() and join() return null rather than array() on an empty result
    * join() returns null if either table to be joined is empty
    * DBA_Toolbox has some more useful functions; note the changes in the
      quickform utility function names
    * code prettied up in numerous places
    * create a few less objects now that more functions can operate statically
      (such as when creating a new database file)
    * changes to the API of remove() and replace(). They act more like
      select() now. The old functionality is found in removeKey() and
      replaceKey()
    * added system tables '_tables' and '_sequences' for storing meta-data
      about tables created by DBA_Relational.
    * added sanity checks for schemas when creating a new table
    * maintenance fixes to the SQL parser; lots of tokens are now defined</n>
