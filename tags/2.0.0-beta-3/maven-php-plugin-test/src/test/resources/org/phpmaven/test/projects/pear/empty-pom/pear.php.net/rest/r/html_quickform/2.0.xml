 <n>New API for new version 2.0 !
      Here is a list of what's new in this version:
		* Moved all the elements from HTML/QuickForm/Elements/ to HTML/QuickForm/
		* Added $_elementIndex to keep track of the elements
		* Changed $_elementValues to $_defaultValues
		* Removed $_hidden and $_frozen
		* Added Filter support
		* Added templates for the _wrap functions
		* Changed loadDefault() to setDefaults()
		* Moved most of the logic to the element classes
		* Created an abstraction between the form class and the elements
		* Added getElement() and getElementValue()
		* Added toArray()
		* Cleaned up a lot of the code
		* Added the // {{{ markers to all files to make it for easier reading in vim
		* Added the error handlers and codes to make errors more descriptive
		* Added new method setConstants() which is like setDefaults() except that it overrides the POST or GET variables.
		* Added methods setElementTemplate(), setFormTemplate(), setHeaderTemplate() and setRequiredNotTemplate().  They are pretty self-explanatory.
		* Added method addData().  Same as before.
		* Added new method clearAllTemplates() which basically strips out all HTML.  This is useful if you want to create a completely custom looking form using addData()
		* Fixed the toHtml() method so that it is a while statement so that freeze() works.
		* Fixed a bug in the hidden type, where it was setting the value when you created the element, thus not allowing the value to be set by POST or GET variables.
		* Took out the is_int test in select.php.
		* Made the caller a global variable in element.php, so that it can be accessed, if need be, in other element classes.
		* Changed it so that if an element is frozen and has no value it outputs '' instead of nothing which messes up old browsers like NS4.
		* Added renderElement() method which will return the html for one element.
		* Added removeElement() method which removes the element from the elements list. Both methods accept parameters.</n>
