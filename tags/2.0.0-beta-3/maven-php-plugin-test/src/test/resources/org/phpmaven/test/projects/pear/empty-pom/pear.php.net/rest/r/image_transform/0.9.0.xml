* files related functions
* addText

* Mirror (Most drivers)
* Flip (Most drivers)
* Add border (soon)
* Add shadow (soon)

 <n>Fixes quite a lot of problems, but still far from stable. GD driver should be much better. ImageMagick is the best driver, especially to deal with transparent and alpha-channel images. Due to the size of the images, the tests are not packaged, use CVS instead.</n>
