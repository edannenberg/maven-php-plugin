 <s>Libravatar.org is a web service similar to Gravatar that supports service federation and Gravatar fallback, as well as allowing users to link avatars images to openid accounts and use a stronger algorithm.</s>
 <d>Services_Libravatar is a class that takes an email address or an openid URL, detects the type of account passed, checks the domain the account is on for the existence of a federated Libravatar instance (with Libravatar.org as fallback if none exists), and then composes a URL for the account's linked avatar image.
