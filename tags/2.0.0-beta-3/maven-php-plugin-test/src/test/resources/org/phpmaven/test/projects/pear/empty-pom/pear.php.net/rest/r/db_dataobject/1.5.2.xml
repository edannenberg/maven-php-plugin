 <s>An SQL Builder, Object Interface to Database Tables</s>
 <d>DataObject performs 2 tasks:
  1. Builds SQL statements based on the objects vars and the builder methods.
  2. acts as a datastore for a table row.
  The core class is designed to be extended for each of your tables so that you put the
  data logic inside the data classes.
  included is a Generator to make your configuration files and your base classes.

 <n>Bug fix release.

Changes:
  - removed automatic strtotime() in setters and setFrom
   ** this is closer to the previous behaviour (it caused too many problems with strange dates
   ** if you set a date/time column with a number, it assumes it is a unixtimestamp
   -- enables you to write setters like 
    function setSome_Date($value) { $this-&gt;fromValue('some_date',strtotime($value)); }
  
Fixes
* $DB_DataObject-&gt;getDatabaseConnection() will return a pear error if dont_die is set,
so it can be used to test connections.
* note changed on databaseStructure, it can be called statically and dynamically.
* fix bug #612 databaseStructure('databasename') will output the ini file structure array , with __keys
* fix bug #611 corrected comment about NO_OVERLOAD
* fix bug #603 to prevent clearing of queries after fetch, use the option keep_query_after_fetch = 1
* fix bug #359 (again) - _link_loaded array should only contain links that where sucessfully loaded</n>
