 <s>An implementation of Integrated Templates API with template 'compilation' added</s>
 <d>HTML_Template_Sigma implements Integrated Templates API designed by Ulf Wendel.

Features:
* Nested blocks. Nesting is controlled by the engine.
* Ability to include files from within template: &amp;lt;!-- INCLUDE --&amp;gt;
* Automatic removal of empty blocks and unknown variables (methods to manually tweak/override this are also available)
* Methods for runtime addition and replacement of blocks in templates
* Ability to insert simple function calls into templates: func_uppercase('Hello world!') and to define callback functions for these
* 'Compiled' templates: the engine has to parse a template file using regular expressions to find all the blocks and variable placeholders. This is a very &quot;expensive&quot; operation and is an overkill to do on every page request: templates seldom change on production websites. Thus this feature: an internal representation of the template structure is saved into a file and this file gets loaded instead of the source one on subsequent requests (unless the source changes)
* PHPUnit-based tests to define correct behaviour
* Usage examples for most of the features are available, look in the docs/ directory

 <n>* Fixed #876 (get_class() and get_class_methods() usage with PHP5)
  Unit tests run on PHP5, all tests pass.
* Added clearVariables() method (see also #939)
* Added shorthand syntax for callbacks: {var:callback} instead of 
  func_callback({var})
* Added builtin callbacks
	'h' for htmlspecialchars()
	'u' for urlencode()
	'j' to escape the string for usage in Javascript
