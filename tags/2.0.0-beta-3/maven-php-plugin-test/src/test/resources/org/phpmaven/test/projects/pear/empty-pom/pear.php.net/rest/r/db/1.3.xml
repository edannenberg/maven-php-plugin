 <s>Database Abstraction Layer</s>
 <d>DB is a database abstraction layer providing:
* an OO-style query API
* a DSN (data source name) format for specifying database servers
* prepare/execute (bind) emulation for databases that don't support it natively
* a result object for each query response
* portable error codes
* sequence emulation
* sequential and non sequential row fetching as well as bulk fetching
* ordered array, associative array and object formats supported for the fetched rows
* row limit support
* transactions support
* table information interface
* DocBook and PHPDoc API documentation

DB layers itself on top of PHP's existing database extensions.  The
currently supported extensions are: dbase, fbsql, interbase, informix,
msql, mssql, mysql, oci8, odbc, pgsql and sybase (DB style interfaces
to LDAP servers and MS ADO (using COM) are also avaible from a separate package).

 <n>New Features:
- Added new option &quot;autofree&quot;, which will free the result automatically when there are no more rows.
Use it with: $db = DB::connect($dsn, array('autofree' =&gt; true));
- Added new methods: buildManipSQL(), autoPrepare() and autoExecute()
- Dropped all references to the unused DB_Warning class
- Added new driver DB_Ado (as a sepparate package), contributed by Alexios Fakos)

Bugs fixed:
- Fix MS SQL server multiple connections under the same script
- The MySQL driver no longer needs to specify a database (allowing queries
with the style database.table)
- Fix parseDSN() to not confuse an Oracle TSN with the protocol
- Adapt the tests paths to work with the new &quot;pear run-tests&quot; (do a &quot;pear download DB&quot;, uncompress
the package and run &quot;pear run-tests tests&quot;).
- Fix numRows() in Oracle driver, that was failing when using &quot;DISTINCT&quot; in query. (Bug #17989)</n>
