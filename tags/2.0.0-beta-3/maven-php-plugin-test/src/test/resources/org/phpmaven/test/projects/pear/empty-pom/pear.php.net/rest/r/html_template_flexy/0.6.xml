 <s>An extremely powerful Tokenizer driven Template engine</s>
 <d>HTML_Template_Flexy started it's life as a simplification of HTML_Template_Xipe, 
however in Version 0.2, It became one of the first template engine to use a real Lexer,
rather than regex'es, making it possible to do things like ASP.net or Cold Fusion tags. 
However, it still has a very simple set of goals.
- Very Simple API, easy to learn...
- Targeted at Object based systems - default behavior is to display object variables
- Designed to allow the documentation of available variables using PEAR standards, eg. PHPDoc comments around object variables
- Ability to edit the templates in WYSIWYG HTML editors, without breaking the tags
- Extremely Fast, for normal variables and looping (or blocks), both for designing and runtime.
- Full dynamic element support (like ASP.NET), so you can pick elements to replace at runtime

Features:
- {variable} to echo $object-&gt;variable
- {method()} to echo $object-&gt;method();
- {foreach:var,key,value} to PHP foreach loops
- tag attributes FLEXY:FOREACH, FLEXY:IF for looping and conditional HTML inclusion
- {if:variable} to PHP If statement
- {if:method()} to PHP If statement
- {else:} and {end:} to close or alternate If statements
- FORM to HTML_Template_Flexy_Element's
- replacement of INPUT, TEXTAREA and SELECT tags with HTML_Template_Flexy_Element code
  use FLEXY:IGNORE (inherited) and FLEXY:IGNOREONLY (single) to prevent replacements
- FLEXY:START/FLEXY:STARTCHILDREN tags to define where output starts/finishes
- support for urlencoded braces {} in HTML attributes.  
- documentation in the pear manual

 <n>This is a major fix release, along with quite a few new usefull features,
many thanks to the various bug reporters, and especially from the Damein Turner and 
The Seagull framework Team

Hopefully, it is now the last beta before a stable release.....

  New features 
  - &amp;lt;flexy:include src=&quot;xxx.html&quot;/&gt; to include other templates
  - &amp;lt;flexy:toJavascript flexy:prefix=&quot;js_name_prefix_&quot; jsvar=&quot;php_flexy_var&quot; ....&gt;
    uses HTML_Javascript_Convert to import PHP variables into Javascript.
  - new modifier :b (for NL2BR + HTMLSPECIALCHARS)
  - support for mulitple paths in templateDir
  - attribute flexy:raw=&quot;{checked}&quot; allows you to to put raw data into a tag.
  - -- double minus, is valid inside comments (not really valid XHTML though)
  - global flexyIgnore option, to prevent global conversion to Elements.
  - better support for elements where name=&quot;someval[]&quot;
  
  Fixes
  - array syntax supported in attributes (eg. urlencoded)
  - setting values of elements with type works (bug #460)
  - methods with multiple arguments fixed.
  - HTML_Template_Flexy_Element::removeAttribute() works
    (removing attributes is done by setting them to false)
  - include error on EndTag
  - closed element (eg. with /&gt; at end, can be used with flexy:if=
  - radio buttons should auto create id's if none are set.
  - xdebug recursion level increased (as the compiler recursion is high)
  - buffered output with $elements fixed.
