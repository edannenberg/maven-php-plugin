 <s>Provides an easy way to perform HTTP requests.</s>
 <d>PHP5 rewrite of HTTP_Request package (with parts of HTTP_Client). Provides
cleaner API and pluggable Adapters:
  * Socket adapter, based on old HTTP_Request code,
  * Curl adapter, wraps around PHP's cURL extension,
  * Mock adapter, to use for testing packages dependent on HTTP_Request2.
Supports POST requests with data and file uploads, basic and digest 
authentication, cookies, managing cookies across requests, proxies, gzip and
deflate encodings, redirects, monitoring the request progress with Observers...</d>

 <n>SSL options for Curl Adapter are always set, this prevents errors when
redirecting from HTTP to HTTPS (bug #18443)</n>
