 <d>It takes an array of data as input and pages it according to various parameters.
It also builds links within a specified range, and allows complete customization of the output (it even works with front controllers and mod_rewrite).
Two operating modes available: &quot;Jumping&quot; and &quot;Sliding&quot; window style.</d>
