 <n>Milestone 2: now with server-side validation support

Major additions and changes:
 * Server-side validation support added
 * API break: changed number and order of parameters for element constructors
 * Fluent interfaces: methods that previously returned nothing now return $this
 * Added method overloading to Container, allowing $form-&gt;addTextarea(...)

Feature requests addressed:
 * Possibility to control validation of an element based on value of some
   other element (request #4534)
 * Rule comparing value of an element with numeric constants (request #4728)
 * Possibility to toggle validation of empty elements (request #9097)

Bug fixes (bugs submitted for HTML_QuickForm package):
 * Wrong options could be selected in &lt;select&gt; elements if numeric strings
   were used as options' values (bug #10837, bug #11138)

Other resources to consider:
 * QF2 development wiki: http://quickform.mamasam.com/wiki/home
 * PHPUnit package from channel pear.phpunit.de is needed to run tests</n>
