 <s>This class acts as an interface to various online weather-services.</s>
 <d>Services_Weather searches for given locations and retrieves current
        weather data and, dependent on the used service, also forecasts. Up to
        now, GlobalWeather from CapeScience, Weather XML from EJSE (US only),
        a XOAP service from Weather.com and METAR/TAF from NOAA are supported.
        Further services will get included, if they become available, have a
        usable API and are properly documented.</d>
