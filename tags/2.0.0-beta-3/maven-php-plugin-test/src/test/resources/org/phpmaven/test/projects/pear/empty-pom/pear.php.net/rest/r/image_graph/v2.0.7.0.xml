 <s>A package for displaying (numerical) data as a graph/chart/plot.</s>
 <d>Image_Graph provides a set of classes that creates graphs/plots/charts based on (numerical) data.

Many different plot types are supported: Bar, line, area, step, impulse, scatter, radar, pie, map, candlestick, band, box &amp; whisker and smoothed line, area and radar plots.

The graph is highly customizable, making it possible to get the exact look and feel that is required.

The output is controlled by a Image_Canvas, which facilitates easy output to many different output formats, amongst others, GD (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WBMP), PDF (using PDFLib), Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG).

Image_Graph is compatible with both PHP4 and PHP5.

 <n>* Added Image_Graph_Plot_Odo (thanks Maxime Delorme)
* Added Image_Graph_DataSelector_Values (thanks Paolo)
* Added best-fit line plot (Image_Graph_Plot_Fit_Line)
* Added possibility to specify the pie plot diameter
* Modified Image_Graph_Plot_CandleStick, it is now only necessary to specify 'open' for first point (other 'open' = previous 'close')
* Changed Image_Graph_Plotarea::hideAxis() to actually hide the axis, not remove them
* Added Image_Graph_Plotarea::clearAxis() to remove the axis
* Fixed markers so that y values equal to null never shows markers
* Fixed problem in Image_Graph_Plot_BoxWhisker causing an undefined method
* Fixed problem with markers and horizontal plots
* Fixed problem with axis not showing arrow-ends even if enabled
* Fixed problem with an error &quot;Call to a member function on a non-object...&quot; in Common.php
* Fixed a problem with Image_Graph_Dataset_Trivial when supplying a datarray as constructor parameter and Image_Graph_Fill_Array
* Fixed Bug #5421 &quot;Documentation for Image_Graph constructor wrong&quot;
* Fixed Bug #5502 &quot;Axis_Logarithmic::setAxisIntersection('max') is broken&quot;    
* Fixed Bug #5504 &quot;PHP Notice: Undefined index: tohtml&quot;
* Fixed PHP notice with Image_Graph::done() when using output to file
* Fixed so it is possible to use array(R, G, B, a?) as fill color
* Fixed issue with markers not rotating along with plot when using setStartingAngle()
* Fixed trivial dataset so that it is possible to use 'id' as key when populating dataset in constructor</n>
