 <n>Warning: this release features numerous BC breaks!

There have been considerable improvements to the datatype, manager and reverse
modules. Furthermore preliminary support for auto increment and primary keys
has been added. Please note that making a field auto increment implies a single
column primary key on this field.

- added support for auto increment and primary key in schema.
- alterTable now needs the full definition to work (use getTableFieldDefinition
 from Reverse module if you do not have a definition at hand) this eliminates the need
 of the declaration part in the alterTable array.
- removed support for dummy_primary_key
- fix PHP4.4 breakage
- moved getInsertID() into core as lastInsertID()
- all non LOB values were quoted twice in execute()
- clobs only need to be mapped to binary when using mysqli_stmt_send_long_data()
  which is handled independently
- use !empty() instead of isset() in fetchRow to determine if result cols were bound or result types were set
- expect keys in type arrays the same way as they are passed for the values in execute() and bindParamArray()
- add s pattern modifier to preg_replace() call for parameter searches in prepare() (bug #5362)
- moved all private fetch mode fix methods into _fixResultArrayValues() for performance reasons
- renamed MDB2_PORTABILITY_LOWERCASE to MDB2_PORTABILITY_FIX_CASE and use 'field_case' option to determine if to upper- or lowercase (CASE_LOWER/CASE_UPPER)
- count() -&gt; !empty() where possible
- use array_map() instead of array_flip(array_change_key_case(array_flip())) to fix case of array values
- use array_key_exists() instead of isset() where possible
- changed structure of field add/remove/change in alterTable() to match MDB2_Schema
- removed subSelect() implementation (now in already included in common)
- return 0 for manipulation queries when disable_query is enabled
- tweaked getTableFieldDefinition() in reverse module
