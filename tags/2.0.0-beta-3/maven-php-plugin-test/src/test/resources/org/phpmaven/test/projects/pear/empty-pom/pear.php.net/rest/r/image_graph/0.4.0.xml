 <s>A package for displaying (numerical) data as a graph/chart/plot.</s>
 <d>Image_Graph provides a set of classes that creates graphs/plots/charts based on (numerical) data.

Many different plot types are supported: Bar, line, area, step, impulse, scatter, radar, pie, map, candlestick, band, box &amp; whisker and smoothed line, area and radar plots.

The graph is highly customizable, making it possible to get the exact look and feel that is required.

The output is controlled by a driver mechanism, which facilitates easy output to many different output formats, amongst others, GD (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WBMP), PDF (using PDFLib), ShockWave Flash (using Ming) and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG).

Image_Graph is compatible with both PHP4 and PHP5 and can be used with both GD1 and GD2 (GD2 is recommended)
