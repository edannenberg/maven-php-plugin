 <s>OO interface for searching and manipulating LDAP-entries</s>
 <d>Net Ldap is a clone of Perls Net::LDAP object interface to
                 ldapservers. It does not contain all of Net::LDAPs features,
                 but has:
                 * A simple OO-interface to connections, searches entries and filters.
                 * Support for tls and ldap v3.
                 * Simple modification, deletion and creation of ldapentries.
                 * Support for schema handling.

                 Net_LDAP layers itself on top of PHP's existing ldap extensions.</d>

 <n>Again some small Bugfixes, most notably a bug within $ldap-&gt;modify() that occured when using the
		combined 'changes' array.
		Besides that, $search-&gt;popEntry() and the corresponding alias pop_entry() has been implemented.
		Net_LDAP_Util::unescape_filter_value() is available too now and Net_LDAP_Util::escape_filter_value()
		can handle ASCII chars smaller than 32. Above that, Net_LDAP_Util::canonical_dn() has been fully implemented.
		A new method createFresh() was added to Net_LDAP_Entry, so creation of initial entries is more
		standardized and clearer.
		A new example is available, describing the $ldap-&gt;modify() method.
		The add_entry.php example was updated, it shows the use of Net_LDAP_Entry::createFresh().
		$ldap-&gt;add() links unlinked entries now to the connection used for the add.
		Some new additional utility functions are available in Net_LDAP_Util to assist you in handling attributes and dns.
		The LDAP-Rename command now uses this functions to deal with DN escaping issues.
		Please note that ldap_explode_dn_escaped() is not available from Net_LDAP_Util anymore; it got superseeded by Net_LDAP_Util::ldap_explode_dn().</n>
