 <s>PHP_Fork class. Wrapper around the pcntl_fork() stuff with a API set like Java language</s>
 <d>PHP_Fork class. Wrapper around the pcntl_fork() stuff
with a API set like Java language.
Practical usage is done by extending this class, and re-defining
the run() method.
[see basic example]
This way PHP developers can enclose logic into a class that extends
PHP_Fork, then execute the start() method that forks a child process.
Communications with the forked process is ensured by using a Shared Memory
Segment; by using a user-defined signal and this shared memory developers
can access to child process methods that returns a serializable variable.
The shared variable space can be accessed with the tho methods:
o void setVariable($name, $value)
o mixed getVariable($name)
$name must be a valid PHP variable name;
$value must be a variable or a serializable object.
Resources (db connections, streams, etc.) cannot be serialized and so theyre not correctly handled.
Requires PHP build with --enable-cli --with-pcntl --enable-shmop.
Only runs on *NIX systems, because Windows lacks of the pcntl ext.
@example browser_pool.php an interactive tool to perform multiple cuncurrent request over an URL.
@example simple_controller.php shows how to attach a controller to started pseudo-threads.
@example exec_methods.php shows a workaround to execute methods into the child process.
@example passing_vars.php shows variable exchange between the parent process and started pseudo-threads.
@example basic.php a basic example, only two pseudo-threads that increment a counter simultaneously.</d>
