 <s>Construct and validate a logical chess game, does not display</s>
 <d>The logic of handling a chessboard and parsing standard
FEN (Farnsworth-Edwards Notation) for describing a position as well as SAN
(Standard Algebraic Notation) for describing individual moves is handled.  This
class can be used as a backend driver for playing chess, or for validating
and/or creating PGN files using the File_ChessPGN package.

Although this package is alpha, it is fully unit-tested.  The code works, but
the API is fluid, and may change dramatically as it is put into use and better
ways are found to use it.  When the API stabilizes, the stability will increase.
