 <n>This is the final stable version of this package. No bugs occured during this long time in RC state and it is considered to be quite solid.
We are currently working on DB_NestedSet2 which will provide a cleaner, pure OOP interface. So watch out for this.

Again:
ATTENTION: The 1.2 api may not be fully backward compatible to the current 1.3 api. To avoid surprises when we go stable please make sure that you test this release 
candidate with your 1.2 apps.
Please look at http://pear.php.net/package/DB_NestedSet/download/1.3 for information on the major changes between
the 1.2 and the 1.3+ releases.

Changes in this release:
- Changed tests to work with current versions of PHPUnit.</n>
