 <s>API to build and query nested sets</s>
 <d>DB_NestedSet let's you create trees with infinite depth
inside a relational database.
The package provides a way to
o create/update/delete nodes
o query nodes, trees and subtrees
o copy (clone) nodes, trees and subtrees
o move nodes, trees and subtrees
o call event handlers on specific events like
  on node deletion
o output the tree
</d>

 <n>The core package is now stable.
You should be able to manipulate a nested set without problems.
The output driver development will always be in progress and there
may always be drivers in beta state.
This package introduces an output driver for TigraMenu
(http://www.softcomplex.com/products/tigra_menu/)
and examples on using the output drivers.
 * Fixed bug in triggerEvent() which produced an error on node move (Daniel Khan)
 * Added isParent() which provides a simple way to query if a given node is parent of another given node. (Daniel Khan)
 * Added a variable to pickNode() which can be used to get a node by another value than id (Daniel Khan)
 * TreeMenu: Fixed bug where two sub nodes that both have children were not being processed correctly (Jason Rust)
 * TreeMenu: Took off example usage since there is now an example page in docs/ (Jason Rust)
 * TigraMenu: Initial import of TigraMenu output driver</n>
