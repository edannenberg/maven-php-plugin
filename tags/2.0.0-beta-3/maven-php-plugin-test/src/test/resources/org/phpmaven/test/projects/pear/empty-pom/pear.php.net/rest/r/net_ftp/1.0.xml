 <s>Comfortable communication with FTP-servers.</s>
 <d>This class allows you to communicate with FTP-servers more comfortable that the ftp-functions of PHP. Especially you can up- and download recursively.

 <n>This the initial stable release of Net_FTP. Another 5 month of testing has been passed and I fixed a few bugs,
which were emailed to me.

Changelog:
-----------

 - Fixed different typos in code, comments and example.
 - Fixed recursive deletion trying to remove &quot;.&quot; and &quot;..&quot; entries in the directorylist.
 - Fixed uploading above 4096 byte, when using ftp_nb_put()
 
ToDo:
-----------
 
 - Add support for Windows FTP-servers
 - Try something for replacing the PHP FTP-functions. (Using sockets, maybe.)
 
Thanks:
-----------

My special thanks go to all who sent me bugreports and interessting feature-requests!

Help:
-----------

Mainly for implementing the socket-issues I maybe need some help. So, if any of you guys are interessted in
writing some code or giving me interesting hints, feel fre to email me!</n>
