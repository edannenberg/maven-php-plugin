*** IMPORTANT: BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES ***

- $twitter-&gt;search-&gt;query() has been replaced by $twitter-&gt;search() (you can also write $twitter-&gt;search-&gt;search())
- the twitter API has changed, so some methods have been updated, removed or added (see above), you'll have probably to update your code
- there are maybe some others incompatible changes, but it will be trivial to update your code</n>
