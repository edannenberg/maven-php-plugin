 <s>A package for building Calendar data structures (irrespective of output)</s>
 <d>Calendar provides an API for building Calendar data structures. Using
the simple iterator and it's &amp;quot;query&amp;quot; API, a user interface can easily be
built on top of the calendar data structure, at the same time easily connecting it
to some kind of underlying data store, where &amp;quot;event&amp;quot; information is
being held.

It provides different calculation &amp;quot;engines&amp;quot; the default being based on
Unix timestamps (offering fastest performance) with an alternative using PEAR::Date
which extends the calendar past the limitations of Unix timestamps. Other engines
should be implementable for other types of calendar (e.g. a Chinese Calendar based
on lunar cycles).</d>
