 <s>PHP interface to Amazon S3's API</s>
 <d>Services_Amazon_S3 is a PHP library for accessing Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3). The library is based on the 2006-03-01 REST API.

Features:
 * list, create and delete buckets, including buckets with location constraints (European buckets)
 * create, read and delete objects including metadata
 * list keys in a bucket using an SPL Iterator with support for paging, key prefixes and delimiters
 * manipulate access control lists for buckets and objects
 * specify the request style (virtualhost, cname, path style) and endpoint
 * get signed URLs to allow a trusted third party to access private files
 * access buckets and objects using PHP filesystem functions through a stream wrapper</d>

 <n>* Fix Bug #15732: Files get truncated when mbstring overloading is enabled
* Fix Bug #15312: Warning in getSignedUrl()
* Fix missing require_once of ServerErrorException.php
* Make getSignedUrl() available for buckets as well
* Stream wrapper option &quot;default_acl&quot; renamed to &quot;acl&quot; (&quot;default_acl&quot; is also supported in this release for backwards compatibility - bug #15893)
* Implement Request #15240: Add ability to set content headers for new objects created via streams
* Preserve ACL in rename() and actually delete the source, i.e. move not copy
* Make Services_Amazon_S3_Resource_Bucket::getURL() throw exception if bucket name is valid for current request style</n>
