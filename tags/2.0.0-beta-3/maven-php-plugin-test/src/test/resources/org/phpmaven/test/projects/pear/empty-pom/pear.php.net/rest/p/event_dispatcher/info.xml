 <s>Dispatch notifications using PHP callbacks</s>
 <d>The Event_Dispatcher acts as a notification dispatch table.
It is used to notify other objects of interesting things. This 
information is encapsulated in Event_Notification objects. Client 
objects register themselves with the Event_Dispatcher as observers of
specific notifications posted by other objects. When an event occurs, 
an object posts an appropriate notification to the Event_Dispatcher.
The Event_Dispatcher dispatches a message to each registered 
observer, passing the notification as the sole argument.</d>
