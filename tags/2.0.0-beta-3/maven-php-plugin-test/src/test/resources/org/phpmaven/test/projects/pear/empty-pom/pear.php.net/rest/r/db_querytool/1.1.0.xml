 <s>An OO-interface for easily retrieving and modifying data in a DB.</s>
 <d>This package is an OO-abstraction to the SQL-Query language, it provides methods such
as setWhere, setOrder, setGroup, setJoin, etc. to easily build queries.
It also provides an easy to learn interface that interacts nicely with HTML-forms using
arrays that contain the column data, that shall be updated/added in a DB.
This package bases on an SQL-Builder which lets you easily build
SQL-Statements and execute them.</d>

 <n>backported most of the latest changes implemented in MDB_QueryTool:
* added getOne() method (request #7580)
* added support for NULL fields in remove() (request #8056)
* fixed bug #3842, using the addJoin/setJoin methods causes an &quot;invalid token&quot; error with ibase;
  the joined table columns aliases are now named in this format: &quot;t_tablename_fieldname&quot; instead of &quot;_tablename_fieldname&quot;.
  Only the ibase driver is affected by this change.
* custom implementation of implode() to circumvent locale handling of floats,
  which clashes with SQL standards
* added table and field name quoting (requests #4613, #5250, #7570, #9197)
* fixed bug #9734, an incorrect regexp adds extraneous table names to the fields,
  if the name of the field appears as a column name in the current table.
* phpdoc and CS fixes
* added new tests
* switched to package.xml v2

NB: This will probably be the last release of DB_QueryTool, which is deprecated
in favour of MDB_QueryTool.</n>
