 <s>A simple way to update packages at run time.</s>
 <d>PEAR_PackageUpdate (PPU) is designed to allow developers to easily include auto updating features for other packages and PEAR installable applications. PPU will check to see if a new version of a package is available and then ask the user if they would like to update the package. PPU uses PEAR to communicate with the channel server and to execute the update.

  PPU allows the end user to take some control over when they are notified about new releases. The PPU Preferences allow a user to tell PPU not to ask about certain types of releases (bug fixes, minor releases, etc.), not to ask about certain release states (devel, alpha, etc.), not to ask until the next release or not to ask again.

  PPU is just an engine for package updating. It should not be used directly. Instead one of the driver packages such as PEAR_PackageUpdate_Gtk2 should be used depending on the application or other package.</d>

 <n>FINAL and first STABLE version after 9 month since last BETA release.
No bug found !

* news
- default configuration file (.ppurc|ppurc.ini) is loaded from and saved into PEAR
configuration directory (PEAR 1.7.0+ cfg_dir directive) if available.

* QA
- require now at least PEAR installer 1.5.4 rather than 1.4.8
(security vulnerability fixes)
- Scott Mattocks is marked as inactive on his request, because he did not have
time to give attention to this package it deserve. Thanks Scott for your past works
on this package, and make this cool features a reality for the community.
- Test Suite used now the .phpt test case rather than phpunit, just in case of a
crash, and recovery of PEAR configuration (suggestion given by Christian Weiske
already in same condition for PEAR_Info).</n>
