 <d>Abstracts parsing and rendering rules for Wiki markup in structured plain text.

 <n>* WARNING: There has been a major change to Wiki class property $rules definition.  This breaks backwards compatibility to 0.7 alpha and earlier for any user-defined rules.
* The $rules property is now an associative array ('rule_name' =&gt; '/path/to/classfile.php'); this allows easier extension of rules by disconnecting the token name from the file name and the class name.
* Minor change to directory structure (Text/Wiki/rules/ is now Text/Wiki/Rule/)
* Removed Wiki class properties $_default_path and $rule_path (superseded by the new $rules property where the file name is explicitly defined)
* Removed method Wiki::_fileExists()
* Modified Wiki::render() to go through the source character-by-character instead of using str_replace (fixes bug where marked-up numbers would sometimes be mistaken for delimited token numbers)
* Modified Rule.php class constructor and all related rule classes to take two params (matches the new $rules property definition)
* Added rule &quot;bold&quot; (uses 3 single-quote ''' marking)
* Added rule &quot;italic&quot; (uses 2 single-quote '' marking)
* Added rule &quot;superscript&quot; (uses double-caret ^^ marking)
* Modified rule &quot;strong&quot; to use double-star (**) marking
* Modified rule &quot;emphasis&quot; to use double-slash (//) marking
* Modified rule &quot;toc&quot; to pass through the source character-by-character instead of using str_replace (fixes bug where marked-up numbers would sometimes be mistaken for delimited token numbers)
* Updated package documentation</n>
