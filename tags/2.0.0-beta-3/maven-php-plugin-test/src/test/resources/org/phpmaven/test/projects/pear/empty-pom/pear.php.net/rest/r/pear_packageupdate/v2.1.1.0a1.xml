 <s>A simple way to update packages at run time.</s>
 <d>PEAR_PackageUpdate (PPU) is designed to allow developers to easily include auto updating features for other packages and PEAR installable applications. PPU will check to see if a new version of a package is available and then ask the user if they would like to update the package. PPU uses PEAR to communicate with the channel server and to execute the update.

  PPU allows the end user to take some control over when they are notified about new releases. The PPU Preferences allow a user to tell PPU not to ask about certain types of releases (bug fixes, minor releases, etc.), not to ask about certain release states (devel, alpha, etc.), not to ask until the next release or not to ask again.

  PPU is just an engine for package updating. It should not be used directly. Instead one of the driver packages such as PEAR_PackageUpdate_Gtk2 should be used depending on the application or other package.</d>

 <n>WARNING: As pear channel did not provided anymore XMLRPC support,
I have not tested the XmlRPC adapter on real server. Tests and feedback are welcome!

[+] New features
- introduce adapter interface to communicate with channel remote server (credits to avb)

[*] Improvements / changes
- with adapters you may now try many protocols (on same call) to check updates
  see test suite PEAR_PackageUpdate_TestSuite_Stub, testCheckUpdateWithSoapOrREST
  as example

[-] Bugfixes
- fix notice error (on unserialize data) when preference file is corrupted
- fix notice error when asking update for a package not yet installed
- add missing error level when pushing some error on stack
- fix error content generated by abstract methods
- fix notice error into getInstalledRelease() when call for package that is not installed

[!] Quality Assurance
- update unit test suites (for PHPUnit 3.2+) with code coverage closest to 100% (84.82)
- fix E_STRICT error</n>
