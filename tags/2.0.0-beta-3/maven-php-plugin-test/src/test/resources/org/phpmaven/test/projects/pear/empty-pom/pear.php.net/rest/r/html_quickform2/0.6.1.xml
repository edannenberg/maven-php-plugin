 <s>PHP5 rewrite of HTML_QuickForm package</s>
 <d>PHP5 rewrite of HTML_QuickForm and HTML_QuickForm_Controller packages.
 
 This package provides methods to create, validate and render HTML forms.
 
 Features:
   * Supports all form elements defined by HTML standard, provides several
     custom elements
   * Server-side and client-side validation, several common rules provided
   * Multipage forms (tabbed forms and wizards)
   * Pluggable elements, rules, renderers and renderer plugins

 Major advantages over PHP4 version:
   * DOM-like API for building the form structure, new streamlined API for 
     elements' values handling
   * Default rendering without tables (inspired by
     HTML_QuickForm_Renderer_Tableless)
   * Renderer plugins for elements with complex rendering needs
   * Ability to chain validation rules with 'and' and 'or'</d>

 <n>Bug fixes
  * Callback renderer did not export setLabelCallback() method (bug #18833)
  * Trying to use Static element under PHP 5.2 resulted in fatal error (bug #18874)
  * persistentFreeze() is on by default for text and password elements

Other features and changes
  * Added an example showing how to output the form with Twig template engine
  * Space characters are no longer allowed in 'id' attribute values (request #18683)
  * Added array type hinting to $data parameter in all elements' constructors
  * Fixed copypasted PHPDoc in several places</n>
