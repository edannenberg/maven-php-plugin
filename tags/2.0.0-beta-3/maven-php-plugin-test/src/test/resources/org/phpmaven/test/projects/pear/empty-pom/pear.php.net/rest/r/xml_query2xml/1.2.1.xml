 <s>Creates XML data from SQL queries</s>
 <d>XML_Query2XML allows you to transform the records retrieved
with one or more SQL SELECT queries into XML data. Very simple to
highly complex transformations are supported. Is was written with
performance in mind and can handle large amounts of data. No XSLT needed!
Major features:
1. XML_Query2XML works with the classes provided by PHP5's built-in DOM API
2. minimum effort necessary to get the simple jobs done
3. highly configurable for more complex tasks
4. ISO/IEC 9075-14:2005 support: mapping of SQL identifiers to XML names
5. works with any database that is supported by PEAR DB, PEAR MDB2 or ADOdb
6. easy integration of other XML data sources (e.g. raw XML data stored in the DB)
7. debugging, logging and profiling features
8. XML encoding: support for UTF-8, ISO-8859-1 and others
9. in-depth documentation and case studies: tutorials and API documentation
10. 803 phpt unit tests</d>

 <n>This fourth stable release contains only some small enhancements:
- dumping the data of all the tables in your database is now easier;
  there is also a new section in the tutorial that describes how to do this:
  http://query2xml.sf.net/docs/html/XML_Query2XML/tutorial_XML_Query2XML.pkg.html#dumpdatabase
  Thanks to vikram dot melonfire at gmail dot com for raising the issue of database dumps
- $sql and $options['idColumn'] now also accept a value of false
- XML_Query2XML now comes with 803 phpt unit tests</n>
