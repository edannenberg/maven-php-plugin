 <n>Bug fix release.

Changes:
  - fixed toValue()
   ** previously did not work correclty..
   ** getXXX($format) correctly relays into toValue - see strftime / Data::format or sprintf
     for formats, depending on column type.
  
Fixes
* fix bug #630 - correct handling of YEAR (it's an int)
* fix bug #630 - mysql timestamps are ingored for updated and insert (use query() if you want to change
  them manually.
* fix bug #620 - limit accepts floats and doubles, as long as they are really integers..</n>
