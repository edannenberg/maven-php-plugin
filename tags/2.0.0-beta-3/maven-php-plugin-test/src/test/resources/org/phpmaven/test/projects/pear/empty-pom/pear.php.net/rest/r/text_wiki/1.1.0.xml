 <s>Abstracts parsing and rendering rules for any markup as Wiki or BBCode in structured plain text.</s>

Used for versatile transformers as well as converters.

 <n>This is a major release as we reduce global resource usage
# instantiate renderers only as needed
# factory() method introduced for instantiating Text_Wiki objects
# singleton() static method to get a single object instanciated pro parser (merci davidc for advices)

The constructor is now deprecated in favor of the new singleton() or factory() methods
Default also have its own class now, wich means Text_Wiki is a pure abstract class

Renderers now have their own methods for:
# text: textEncode() defaulted to php htmlspecialchars()
  for Xhtml render to the text encoding choosed in conf (#5953, thanks jocke at selincite dot com)
# url: urlEncode() defaulted to the php rawurlencode()

Wiki general:
# Correct the key used in changeRule(), ensure no double new rule.
# Page names and anchors Urlencode() as render required (e.g. may contain spaces)
# Interwiki: parser may now give the full url instead of site+page (Mediawiki need)
# Improved test.

Latex render:
# Only variables should be assigned by reference (#6010, thanks twells at smarterliving dot com)

Plain render:
# Interwiki: Complete the rendering with indication of (url) or (site:page)

Xhtml render:
# Rendering Fix for Tables (Missing Whitespace) (thanks ritzmo)
# Added support for two-token URLs
## This allows formatting within URL text and proper rendering into other Wiki dialects (assuming that your parser supports the new feature. The Default parser does not yet support this.)

Maintainers:
# Del , one of the funders of the original code fully as pear developer
# JustinP is now lead</n>
