 <s>Implementation of the NNTP protocol</s>
 <d>Package for communicating with NNTP/Usenet servers
</d>
 <da>2005-01-14 15:15:25</da>
 <n>- This release is NOT backward compatible with v0.11.3, since all non-stable features (classes, methods etc.) have been removed!!!
- Users of releases between 0.3.x and 0.11.x should consider v1.1.x or v1.2.x in stead. (This release is meant only as a final replacement for v0.2.5 - and of cause as a way to finally get rid of the former protocol implementation).
- Backward compatible with v0.2.5 (this is ONLY guarantied in v1.0.x releases, and may be removed in the future).</n>
