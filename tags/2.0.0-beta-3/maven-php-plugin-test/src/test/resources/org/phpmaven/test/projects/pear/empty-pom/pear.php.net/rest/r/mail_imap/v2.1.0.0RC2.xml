 <s>Provides a c-client backend for webmail.</s>
 <d>Mail_IMAP provides a simplified backend for working with the c-client (IMAP) extension. It serves as an OO wrapper for commonly used c-client functions. It provides structure and header parsing as well as body retrieval.
Mail_IMAP provides a simple inbox example that demonstrates its ability to parse and view simple and multipart email messages.
Mail_IMAP also provides a connection wizard to determine the correct protocol and port settings for a remote mail server, all you need to provide is a server, a username and a password.
Mail_IMAP may be used as a webmail backend or as a component in a mailing list manager.

 <n>Updated message parsing algorithms to accept double digit part ids addressing
the first major bug reported in the program.
This bug affected:
Mail_IMAP::_scanMultipart
Mail_IMAP::getDefaultPid
Mail_IMAP::_defaultHeaderPid
Altered Mail_IMAP::delete to accept either an array of message ids instead or
a single string.  Added an optional separator argument for any errors returned
by imap_delete when using an array.
Altered Mail_IMAP::extractMIME to accept either an array of MIME types or
a single string.</n>
