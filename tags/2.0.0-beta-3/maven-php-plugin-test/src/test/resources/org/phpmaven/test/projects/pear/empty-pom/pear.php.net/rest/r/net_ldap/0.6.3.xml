 <s>OO interface for searching and manipulating LDAP-entries</s>
 <d>Net Ldap is a clone of Perls Net::LDAP object interface to 
ldapservers. It does not contain all of Net::LDAPs features, 
but has:
* A simple OO-interface to connections, searches and entries.
* Support for tls and ldap v3.
* Simple modification, deletion and creation of ldapentries.
* Support for schema handling.

Net_LDAP layers itself on top of PHP's existing ldap extensions.

 <n>It seems that 0.6.2 was out too fast. So this is mainly a bugfix release:   
- Removed remaining Net_LDAP::UTF8Encode and Net_LDAP::UTF8Decode calls in Net_LDAP_Entry,
  which stopped attributes() and get_entry() from working
- The UTF8 functions somehow got outside the Net_LDAP class ... FIXED.
- The usuage example of the last release was wrong. We decided to move UTF8 handling into Net_LDAP.
  Handling should be done this way:

$attr = $ldap-&gt;utf8Encode($attr);
$entry-&gt;modify($attr);
$attr = $ldap-&gt;utf8Decode( $entry-&gt;attributes() );
- This means Net_LDAP_Util is useless right now, but will be extended in the future.
- Jan did a complete overhaul of the phpdoc stuff. Everything seems to be fine now with phpDocumentor.</n>
