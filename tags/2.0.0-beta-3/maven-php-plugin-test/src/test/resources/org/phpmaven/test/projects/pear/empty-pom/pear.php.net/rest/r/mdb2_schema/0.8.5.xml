 <s>XML based database schema manager</s>
 <d>PEAR::MDB2_Schema enables users to maintain RDBMS independant schema
files in XML that can be used to create, alter and drop database entities
and insert data into a database. Reverse engineering database schemas from
existing databases is also supported. The format is compatible with both
PEAR::MDB and Metabase.</d>

 <n>- PEAR dependency updated (Bug #15923)
- XML_DTD dependency updated (past releases of XML_DTD doesn't works anymore. release 0.5.1 works only with PHP 5).
- Fixed 'disable_queries' and 'show_structure' options that were malfunctioning in mdb2_schematool web version
- Added an option to not drop obsolete tables when updating (Request #15278). It defaults not to drop, which reverts the behavior introduced in Release 0.8.3

open todo items:
- Clean up output of getDefinitionFromDatabase(). Sync it with Parser and Parser2.
- Automatically load reserved keywords
- Make MDB2_Schema loadable via MDB2_Driver_Common::loadModule() (Bug #8270)
- Allow simple if statements that mean that anything enclosed is only executed
  if it meets certain criterias based on that version number (or some other
  variable). This would enable people to add DML statements that are only
  executed when updating from a specific version.
- Modularize Writer code or remake it
- Add specific error codes for Validate class
- Add support for ORDER clauses on UPDATEs (to resolve the duplicate key 
  problem)
- Update description.schema.xml
- Create unit test for comparedefinitions()
- Create unit test for initializetable()
- Create unit test to compare the expected array definition with what is parsed
- Improve validateDataFieldValue() to validate &lt;column&gt;
- Provide more info on MDB2_Schema_Validate errors (output parsed value and expected value)
- Views support
- Fulltext index support
- PKs as constraints, not indices
- Creation of constraints only after all tables have been created/updated to avoid invalid references.</n>
