 <s>Daemon to store session data that can be accessed via a simple protocol.</s>
 <d>HTTP_SessionServer is a simple PHP based daemon that helps you maintaining state between physically different hosts.
HTTP_SessionServer implements a very simple protocol to store and retrieve data on the server. The storage backend is driver based, currently only a storage for the filesystem has been implemented, but you may easily change this.
HTTP_SessionServer comes with a matching client implementation using Net_Socket as well as a session save handler.
