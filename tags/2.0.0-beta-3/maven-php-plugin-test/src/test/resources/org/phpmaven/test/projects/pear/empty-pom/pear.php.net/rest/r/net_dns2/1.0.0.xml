 <s>PHP5 Resolver library used to communicate with a DNS server.</s>
 <d>Provides (roughly) the same functionality as Net_DNS, but using PHP5 objects, exceptions for error handling, better sockets support.

This release is (in most cases) 2x - 10x faster than Net_DNS, as well as includes more RR's (including DNSSEC RR's), and improved sockets and streams support.</d>

 <n>- finished support for the OPT, APL, and the HIP RR
- fixed a small bug in the Net_DNS2_RR::fromString method when parsing strings. apparently PHP doesn't think that 0 is numeric sometimes
- updated the @since value for all the files; it was set with the incorrect version.</n>
