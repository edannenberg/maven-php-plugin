 <s>A reverse-engineering package that scans PHP files and directories, and delivers an UML/XMI representation of the classes and packages found.</s>
 <d>PHP_UML is a PHP parser, an XMI generator, as well as a metamodel-driven application.
Practically, with PHP_UML, you can feed an UML CASE tool, like Rational Rose or Argouml, with an
UML representation of existing PHP source code. This way, you get an instant overview of a given
application, with all the usual functions of a software design tool, 
like class diagrams exportation, refactoring of object-oriented applications, 
or automatic code generation.

PHP_UML :
- Parses classes, interfaces, inheritance and implementation relations
- Parses properties, class constants, visibility and static attributes
- Parses functions, their parameters, their default values, their types (when stated)
- Parses docblock comments : class comments (@package), function comments (@param and @return) and header file comments (@package)
- Interprets the PHP namespacing instructions (&quot;namespace&quot; and &quot;use&quot;)
- Does automatic type detection, through the default values
- Generates UML in version 1.4, and version 2.1
- Generates logical, component, and deployment views

Other UML elements will be available in future releases.</d>
