 <s>PEAR_PackageFileManager takes an existing package.xml file and updates it with a new filelist and changelog</s>
 <d>This package revolutionizes the maintenance of PEAR packages.  With a few parameters,
the entire package.xml is automatically updated with a listing of all files in a package.
Features include
 - manages the new package.xml 2.0 format in PEAR 1.4.0
 - can detect PHP and extension dependencies using PHP_CompatInfo
 - reads in an existing package.xml file, and only changes the release/changelog
 - a plugin system for retrieving files in a directory.  Currently four plugins
   exist, one for standard recursive directory content listing, one that
   reads the CVS/Entries files and generates a file listing based on the contents
   of a checked out CVS repository, one that reads Subversion entries files, and
   one that queries a Perforce repository.
 - incredibly flexible options for assigning install roles to files/directories
 - ability to ignore any file based on a * ? wildcard-enabled string(s)
 - ability to include only files that match a * ? wildcard-enabled string(s)
 - ability to manage dependencies
 - can output the package.xml in any directory, and read in the package.xml
   file from any directory.
 - can specify a different name for the package.xml file

PEAR_PackageFileManager is fully unit tested.
The new PEAR_PackageFileManager2 class is not.</d>

 <n>THIS VERSION IS THE LAST ONE BEFORE FINAL STABLE 1.6.0

* news
- First major change is ability to import all tasks files (replace, eol, postscriptinstall) of an existing package xml (1.0 or 2.0), with just one option &quot;clearcontents&quot;.
- The second major change is ability to use all options of PHP_CompatInfo 1.4.0 (or better) to detect easily all dependencies (PHP version and PHP extensions used).
- &quot;exportCompatiblePackageFile1&quot; method is now deprecated. Produces only a simple version of package xml 1.0 without tasks files
