 <s>Provides an easy way to perform HTTP requests.</s>
 <d>PHP5 rewrite of HTTP_Request package. Provides cleaner API and pluggable
Adapters. Currently available are:
  * Socket adapter, based on old HTTP_Request code,
  * Curl adapter, wraps around PHP's cURL extension,
  * Mock adapter, to use for testing packages dependent on HTTP_Request2.
Supports POST requests with data and file uploads, basic and digest 
authentication, cookies, proxies, gzip and deflate encodings, monitoring 
the request progress with Observers...</d>

 <n>* Added 'store_body' config parameter, if set to false it will prevent storing
  the response body in Response object (request #15881)
* HTTP_Request2::setHeader() method now works as documented, setHeader('name') 
  will remove the 'name' header, while setHeader('name', '') will set 'name'
  header to empty value (bug #15937)
* Custom 'Host' header will not be overwritten by generated one (bug #16146)
* When trying to reuse the connected socket in Socket adapter, make sure that
  it is still connected (bug #16149)</n>
