 <s>Creates XML data from SQL queries</s>
 <d>XML_Query2XML allows you to transform the records retrieved
with one or more SQL SELECT queries into XML data. Very simple to
highly complex transformations are supported. Is was written with
performance in mind and can handle large amounts of data. No XSLT needed!

2. minimum effort necessary to get the simple jobs done
3. highly configurable for more complex tasks
4. ISO/IEC 9075-14:2005 support: mapping of SQL identifiers to XML names
5. works with any database that is supported by PEAR DB, PEAR MDB2 or ADOdb
6. debugging and logging features
7. provides profiling features
8. in-depth documentation: tutorials and API documentation
9. Eight case studies: from very simple to highly complex scenarios
10. 433 phpt unit tests</d>

 <n>I am very proud to announce the first stable release of XML_Query2XML.
This release introduces only one minor change. It's not
a bug fix but just a matter of clean code. The patch
was anonymously submitted via the project's sourceforge site
(Note: pear.php.net should be used instead).

If you are upgrading from v0.6.x or v0.7.x, please read
