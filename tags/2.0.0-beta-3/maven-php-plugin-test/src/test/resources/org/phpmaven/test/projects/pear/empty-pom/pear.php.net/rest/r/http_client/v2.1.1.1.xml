 <s>Easy way to perform multiple HTTP requests and process their results</s>
 <d>The HTTP_Client class wraps around HTTP_Request and provides a higher level interface 
for performing multiple HTTP requests.

Features:
* Manages cookies and referrers between requests
* Handles HTTP redirection
* Has methods to set default headers and request parameters
* Implements the Subject-Observer design pattern: the base class sends 
events to listeners that do the response processing.</d>
 <da>2007-05-19 13:50:29</da>
 <n>* Switched to package.xml 2.0
* Switched to BSD license
* Proper header comment blocks and various phpdoc fixes
* Added a switch controlling serialization of session cookies to CookieManager
  class, use serializeSessionCookies(true) to enable their serialization. The
  default behaviour is still to delete them (request #8778, also #9142)</n>
