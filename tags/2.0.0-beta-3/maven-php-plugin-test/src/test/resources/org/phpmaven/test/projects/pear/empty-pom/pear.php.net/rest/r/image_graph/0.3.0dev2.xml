 <s>Graph rendering utility.</s>
 <d>This package helps you to easily create highly versatile graphs.

 <n>* Added functionality for multi-level labels (ticks, text, etc.) to support for minor and major labels (and more if needed)
* Added fontmapping in GD drivers useful for mapping mnemonic fontnames, i.e. Times New Roman to font file names (either partial or full)
* Added configuration option in Config.php (IMAGE_GRAPH_SYSTEM_FONT_PATH) enabling to specify default search path for system fonts
    - On Windows systems this defaults to %SYSTEMROOT%\Fonts\
* Added 'auto' split on layouts - calculated automatically based on actual sizes of the parts (supported only with titles)
* Added visual tests - not PHPUnit, test cases:
    - Basic testing if requirements are met (GD + Freetype)
    - Testcases for testing drivers
    - Plot tests
    - Axis tests
* Added support for setting width on the bars in a bar chart
* Added setFontColor(), setFontSize(), setFontAngle() to elements for easy change of properties of propagating fonts, without needing to create a new object
* Added new setTitle() method to axis to allow for easier displaying of axis titles
* Added Image_Graph_Plot_CandleStick to display financial charts for the stock market
* Added Image_Graph_Plot_Band
* Added major tick customizability to axis
* Added possibility to use user-defined values as axis-labels
* Added support for adding an array to Image_Graph_Dataset_Trivial for easy point addition
* Added some error/insanity checks
* Added Image_Graph_Tool class with static function for bezier curve-smoothing for drivers without native support (fx. GD)
* Added Image_Graph_Axis::setAxisIntersection() to specify a value for which the axis intersects another axis (i.e. Y-axis intersects X-axis in x=1 instead of x=0)
* Implemented drivers to support different output formats
    - Currently full GD (JPEG/PNG/GIF/WBMP), SVG and PDF (PDFlib) support
    - Semi-supported drivers SWF (Ming)
    - Drivers planned SVG (XML_SVG), PDF (File_PDF) and SWF (libswf)
    - No BC breaking API changes
    - Currently no support for animations, i.e. SVG and SWF
* Re-implemented support for line styles
* Fonts now propagate through the structure, meaning if you set a font on the Graph all other elements inherit this font (but can be overridden)
    - This does *not* break BC
* Modified Image_Graph_Axis_Radar to be a category axis
* Modified Image_Graph_Dataset to allow for y-value to be an array of values (to support candlestick diagrams)
* Changed pie chart legends, so they show all data values as legend except just one for complete chart
* Changed logging behaviour (added Image_Graph::setLog() method)
* Changed while-list-each to foreach for performance reasons (minor)
* Changed Image_Graph_Title constructor slightly (second parameter, see Docs. for details)
* Changed Image_Graph_Axis::setTitle() slightly to accomodate propagating fonts (no BC break)
* Included some more aliases for the Image_Graph::factory() method
* Updated how bar charts calculate width
* Legends now scale properly
* Legends now show differently depending on plot type
* API Changes with minor impact on BC
    - Removed caching
    - Removed Image_Graph::saveAs(), functionality moved to Image_Graph_Driver::done() method
    - Removed Image_Graph::thumbnail()
    - Removed Image_Graph_Axis_Multidimensional, mainly for perfomance reasons
    - Image_Graph_Fill now inherits from Image_Graph_Common (instead of Image_Graph_Element)
    - Removed GLOBAL font variables
* Fixed problems with Image_Graph_Axis_Radar showing values in wrong order
* Fixed bug causing negative bars to display incorrecly (why o' why is 0 == 'some string'?)
* Fixed bug causing setLineStyle() to fail
* Fixed Bug #2684 &quot;Source typo breaking data selectors&quot;
* Fixed Bug #2685 &quot;Plots do not honor ID tags for fills&quot;
* Fixed bug #2791 &quot;wrong x-axis label position when using ttf font&quot;
* Fixed bug causing displayErrors() to generate WARNING and FATAL ERROR
* Fixed problems with gradient fills (did not display propery using GD drivers)
* Fixed problem with bar-, area-, step- and impulse-charts when using forceMinimum(), causing bars to display 'below' x-axis
* Fixed Image_Graph_Axis::force(Minimum|Maximum)
* Removed default Image_Graph logo
* Removed _graphWidth() and _graphHeight(), they are now handled by the driver</n>
