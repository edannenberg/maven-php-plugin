 <s>Framework to build Macromedia Flex applications.</s>
 <d>Flex enables enterprise-class Rich Internet Applications and is 
  designed to address a certain class of problems around multistep processes, 
  client-side validation, data manipulation, and data visualization. This
  package allows you to build flex documents programatically.
  MXML is the XML language for writing Macromedia Flex applications that you 
  can use to lay out user-interface components. 
  You can also use MXML to declaratively define nonvisual aspects of an application,
  such as access to server-side data sources and data bindings between 
  user-interface components and server-side data sources.
  The API follows closely Stephan Schmidts XUL-Package.</d>
