 <s>Creates XML data from SQL queries</s>
 <d>XML_Query2XML allows you to transform the records retrieved
with one or more SQL SELECT queries into XML data. Very simple to
highly complex transformations are supported. Is was written with
performance in mind and can handle large amounts of data. No XSLT needed!
Major features:
1. XML_Query2XML works with the classes provided by PHP5's built-in DOM API
2. minimum effort necessary to get the simple jobs done
3. highly configurable for more complex tasks
4. ISO/IEC 9075-14:2005 support: mapping of SQL identifiers to XML names
5. works with any database that is supported by PEAR DB, PEAR MDB2 or ADOdb
6. easy integration of other XML data sources (e.g. raw XML data stored in the DB)
7. debugging, logging and profiling features
8. XML encoding: support for UTF-8, ISO-8859-1 and others
9. in-depth documentation and case studies: tutorials and API documentation
10. 783 phpt unit tests</d>

 <n>This third stable release contains a new feature and some minor coding-style related changes
- it is now possible to handle data sources that use another character encoding
  than ISO-8859-1; see the 'encoder' option:
  http://query2xml.sf.net/docs/html/XML_Query2XML/tutorial_XML_Query2XML.pkg.html#query2xml_getxml.options_encoder
  Thanks to Mickael Guerin for making me implement this feature that has been sitting on my
  todo list for quite some time now.
- other character encodings than UTF-8 can now also be used for XML encoding; see
  http://query2xml.sf.net/docs/html/XML_Query2XML/tutorial_XML_Query2XML.pkg.html#encoding
- unit tests are now correctly skipped if the database connection fails
- XML_Query2XML now comes with 783 phpt unit tests</n>
