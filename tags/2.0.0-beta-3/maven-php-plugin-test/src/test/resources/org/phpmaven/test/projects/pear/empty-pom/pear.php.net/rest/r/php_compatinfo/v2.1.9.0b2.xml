 <s>Find out the minimum version and the extensions required for a piece of code to run</s>
 <d>PHP_CompatInfo will parse a file/folder/script/array to find out the minimum
version and extensions required for it to run. Features advanced debug output
which shows which functions require which version and CLI output script</d>
 <da>2008-12-19 02:14:10</da>
 <n>* IMPORTANT
- if you are PHP5 user only:
  use the pciconf script to build your own extension support list
- if you are PHP4 user only:
  pciconf script required at least PHP5 to run, so to build your own support list,
  do it by hand. All major extensions and their PCI dictionaries are available
  on PEAR CVS [http://cvs.php.net/viewvc.cgi/pear/PHP_CompatInfo/CompatInfo/]
- A more comprehensive guide will be available for final stable release, ready for
  PhD system and new PEAR Manual.

* news
- pciconf: the extension support list build system for PHP5 users only
  use now a new exception handler for functions, and allow to make SAPI dictionaries
- improve again constant detection by adding a new dictionaries for internal
  (php core) constants.
- 3 new methods: getIgnoredFunctions, getIgnoredExtensions, getIgnoredConstants
- 1 old method open to public: getIgnoredFiles

You are welcome to read my presentation about the new API at
http://pear.laurent-laville.org/pepr/PHP_CompatInfo/api190/

Do not hesitate to give me your feedback. More we test it, more stable will be
the final version.

* roadmap
- 2008-11-23 first alpha version
- 2008-11-26 first beta version
- 2008-12-19 second beta release
