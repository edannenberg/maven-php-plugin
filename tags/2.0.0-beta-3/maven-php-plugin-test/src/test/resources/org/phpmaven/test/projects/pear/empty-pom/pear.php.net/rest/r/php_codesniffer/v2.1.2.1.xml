 <s>PHP_CodeSniffer tokenises PHP, JavaScript and CSS files and detects violations of a defined set of coding standards.</s>
 <d>PHP_CodeSniffer is a PHP5 script that tokenises and &quot;sniffs&quot; PHP, JavaScript and CSS files to detect violations of a defined coding standard. It is an essential development tool that ensures your code remains clean and consistent. It can also help prevent some common semantic errors made by developers.</d>

 <n>- Added a new report type --report=svnblame to show how many errors and warnings were committed by each author
  -- Also shows the percentage of their code that are errors and warnings
  -- Requires you to have the SVN command in your path
  -- Make sure SVN is storing usernames and passwords (if required) or you will need to enter them for each file
  -- You can also use the -s command line argument to see the different types of errors authors are committing
  -- You can use the -v command line argument to see all authors, even if they have no errors or warnings
- Added a new command line argument --report-width to allow you to set the column width of screen reports
  -- Reports wont accept values less than 70 or else they get too small
  -- Can also be set via a config var: phpcs --config-set report_width 100
- You can now get PHP_CodeSniffer to ignore a whole file by adding @codingStandardsIgnoreFile in the content
  -- If you put it in the first two lines the file wont even be tokenized, so it will be much quicker
- Reports now print their file lists in alphabetical order
- PEAR FunctionDeclarationSniff now reports error for incorrect closing bracket placement in multi-line definitions
- Added Generic CallTimePassByRefenceSniff to prohibit the passing of variables into functions by reference
  -- Thanks to Florian Grandel for the contribution
- Added Squiz DisallowComparisonAssignmentSniff to ban the assignment of comparison values to a variable
- Added Squiz DuplicateStyleDefinitionSniff to check for duplicate CSS styles in a single class block
- Squiz ArrayDeclarationSniff no longer checks the case of array indexes because that is not its job
- Squiz PostStatementCommentSniff now allows end comments for class member functions
- Squiz InlineCommentSniff now supports the checking of JS files
- MySource CreateWidgetTypeCallbackSniff now allows the callback to be passed to another function
- MySource CreateWidgetTypeCallbackSniff now correctly ignores callbacks used inside conditions
- Generic MultipleStatementAlignmentSniff now enforces a single space before equals sign if max padding is reached
- Fixed a problem in the JS tokenizer where regular expressions containing \// were not converted correctly
- Fixed a problem tokenizing CSS files where multiple ID targets on a line would look like comments
- Fixed a problem tokenizing CSS files where class names containing a colon looked like style definitions
- Fixed a problem tokenizing CSS files when style statements had empty url() calls
- Fixed a problem tokenizing CSS colours with the letter E in first half of the code
- Squiz ColonSpacingSniff now ensures it is only checking style definitions in CSS files and not class names
- Squiz DisallowComparisonAssignmentSniff no longer reports errors when assigning the return value of a function
- CSS tokenizer now correctly supports multi-line comments
- When only the case of var names differ for function comments, the error now indicates the case is different
- Fixed an issue with Generic UnnecessaryStringConcatSniff where it incorrectly suggested removing a concat
