 <s>database abstraction layer</s>
 <d>PEAR MDB2 is a merge of the PEAR DB and Metabase php database abstraction layers.

Note that the API will be adapted to better fit with the new php5 only PDO
before the first stable release.

It provides a common API for all supported RDBMS. The main difference to most
other DB abstraction packages is that MDB2 goes much further to ensure
portability. Among other things MDB2 features:
* An OO-style query API
* A DSN (data source name) or array format for specifying database servers
* Datatype abstraction and on demand datatype conversion
* Various optional fetch modes to fix portability issues
* Portable error codes
* Sequential and non sequential row fetching as well as bulk fetching
* Ability to make buffered and unbuffered queries
* Ordered array and associative array for the fetched rows
* Prepare/execute (bind) emulation
* Sequence emulation
* Replace emulation
* Limited sub select emulation
* Row limit support
* Transactions support
* Large Object support
* Index/Unique Key/Primary Key support
* Autoincrement emulation
* Module framework to load advanced functionality on demand
* Ability to read the information schema
* RDBMS management methods (creating, dropping, altering)
* Reverse engineering schemas from an existing DB
* SQL function call abstraction
* Full integration into the PEAR Framework
* PHPDoc API documentation

 <n>- fixed testNow() to use the datatype abstraction
- fixed testGetTableFieldDefinition() to use a blob column instead of a clob
  since we default to blob when we cannot differntiate between blob and clob
- split up alterTable() testing into two separate test methods
- removed errorNative() was never implemented, use errorInfo() instead
- fixed major bug in _fixResultArrayValues() that would lead to performance or
  incorrect application of portability features
- phpdoc fixes in LOB.php, Iterator.php, Date.php and Extended.php
- removed not required prev() and hasPrev() from the SeekableIterator implementation</n>
