 <s>Creates XML data from SQL queries</s>
 <d>XML_Query2XML allows you to transform the records retrieved
with one or more SQL SELECT queries into XML data. Very simple to
highly complex transformations are supported. Is was written with
performance in mind and can handle large amounts of data. No XSLT needed!
Major features:
1. XML_Query2XML works with the classes provided by PHP5's built-in DOM API
2. minimum effort necessary to get the simple jobs done
3. highly configurable for more complex tasks
4. ISO/IEC 9075-14:2005 support: mapping of SQL identifiers to XML names
5. works with any database that is supported by PDO, PEAR DB, PEAR MDB2 or ADOdb
6. easy integration of other XML data sources (e.g. raw XML data stored in the DB)
7. debugging, logging and profiling features
8. XML encoding: support for UTF-8, ISO-8859-1 and others
9. in-depth documentation and case studies: tutorials and API documentation
10. 1144 phpt unit tests</d>

 <n>This release candidate comes after extensive re-factoring:
- XML_Query2XML now does a lot of internal pre-processing
- this improves performance by at least 30%
- all exceptions now contain information that relates to the
  configuration option that caused the exception to be thrown
- caching is now deactivated by default as is not needed in
  most cases; see $options['sql_options']['cached']
- XML_Query2XML now comes with 1144 phpt unit tests
Note: if 1.5.0RC1 does not cause any problems for early adopters
(which I consider very unlikely) 1.5.0 will be released next weekend.</n>
