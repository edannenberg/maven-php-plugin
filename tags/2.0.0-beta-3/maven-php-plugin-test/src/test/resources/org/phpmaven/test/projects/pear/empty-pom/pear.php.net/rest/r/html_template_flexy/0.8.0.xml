 <s>An extremely powerful Tokenizer driven Template engine</s>
 <d>HTML_Template_Flexy started it's life as a simplification of HTML_Template_Xipe, 
however in Version 0.2, It became one of the first template engine to use a real Lexer,
rather than regex'es, making it possible to do things like ASP.net or Cold Fusion tags. 
However, it still has a very simple set of goals.
- Very Simple API, 
   o easy to learn...
   o prevents to much logic going in templates
- Easy to write document'able code
   o By using object vars for a template rather than 'assign', you 
     can use phpdoc comments to list what variable you use.
- Editable in WYSIWYG editors
   o you can create full featured templates, that doesnt get broken every time you edit with 
     Dreamweaver(tm) or Mozzila editor
   o Uses namespaced attributes to add looping/conditionals  
- Extremely Fast, 
   o runtime is at least 4 time smaller than most other template engines (eg. Smarty)
   o uses compiled templates, as a result it is many times faster on blocks and loops than 
     than Regex templates (eg. IT/phplib)
- Safer (for cross site scripting attacks)
   o All variables default to be output as HTML escaped (overridden with the :h modifier)
- Multilanguage support
   o Parses strings out of template, so you can build translation tools
   o Compiles language specific templates (so translation is only done once, not on every request)
- Full dynamic element support (like ASP.NET), so you can pick elements to replace at runtime

Features:
- {variable} to echo $object-&gt;variable
- {method()} to echo $object-&gt;method();
- {foreach:var,key,value} to PHP foreach loops
- tag attributes FLEXY:FOREACH, FLEXY:IF for looping and conditional HTML inclusion
- {if:variable} to PHP If statement
- {if:method()} to PHP If statement
- {else:} and {end:} to close or alternate If statements
- FORM to HTML_Template_Flexy_Element's
- replacement of INPUT, TEXTAREA and SELECT tags with HTML_Template_Flexy_Element code
  use FLEXY:IGNORE (inherited) and FLEXY:IGNOREONLY (single) to prevent replacements
- FLEXY:START/FLEXY:STARTCHILDREN tags to define where template starts/finishes
- support for urlencoded braces {} in HTML attributes.  
- documentation in the pear manual

 <n>Feature addition release:

  Moving to stable is posponed another month, so these new features get a thorough testing.
  
Bugs / Fixes:
  * fixed overzealous closing on some tags 
  * fixed double html escaping of some dynamic attributes
  * ignore empty url_rewrite options (eg. images/:/templates/images,,)
  * fixed recursion death, on &amp;lt;s&amp;gt; tags
  * fixed flexy {variables} inside attributes='that are single quoted'
  * unknown namespaces are assumed to be HTML (so XUL with html works ok)
  
Features:
  * Translation2 transparent translation backend support
    $options['Translation2'] = array(
            'driver' =&gt; 'dataobjectsimple',
            'options' =&gt; array()
      )
    will instantate Translation2 once , and call it to translate 
    all strings found when compiling.
    
  * Strings to be translated can be explicitly marked by encapsulating them
    in {_( ....... )_} 
    Parsing is done prior to tokenizing, so you can include {variables} inside
    the translation strings.
    
  * Access to private variables and methods now possible eg. 
    {_myprivate_var}
    ** requires option['privates'] = true
    
  * Access to super global variables now possible eg. 
    {_SESSION[lang]} {_GET[posted]} {_POST[posted]}
    {_REQUEST[lang]} {GLOBALS[posted]} {_COOKIES[posted]}
    ** requires option['globals'] = true
    (as per all variable, these are html escaped by default, for security reasons,
     over-ride with the :h modifier)
  
  * Access to php functions now possible
    {GLOBALS.date(mydate,#d/m/y#)}
    ** requires option['globalfunctions'] = true
    ** this is a big security hole if you dont trust your template authors,
       it exposes exec() etc.
    
  * New Test infrastructure in CVS - enabling better unit testing.</n>
