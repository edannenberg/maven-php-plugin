 <s>PEAR Base System</s>
 <d>The PEAR package contains:

 * the PEAR_Error error handling mechanism
 * the OS_Guess class for retrieving info about the OS

   with files and directories
 * the PEAR base class

  Features in a nutshell:

    restricted host installation
  * full support for mirroring
  * support for bundling several packages into a single tarball
  * support for static dependencies on a url-based package
  * support for custom file roles and installation tasks</d>
