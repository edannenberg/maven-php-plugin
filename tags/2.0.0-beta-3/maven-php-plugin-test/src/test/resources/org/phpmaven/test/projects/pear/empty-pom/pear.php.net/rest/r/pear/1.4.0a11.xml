 <n>This is a major milestone release for PEAR.  In addition to several killer features,
  every single element of PEAR has a regression test, and so stability is much higher
  than any previous PEAR release, even with the alpha label.

  New features in a nutshell:
  * full support for channels
  * pre-download dependency validation
  * new package.xml 2.0 format allows tremendous flexibility while maintaining BC
  * support for optional dependency groups and limited support for sub-packaging
  * robust dependency support
  * full dependency validation on uninstall
  * support for binary PECL packages
  * remote install for hosts with only ftp access - no more problems with
    restricted host installation
  * full support for mirroring
  * support for bundling several packages into a single tarball
  * support for static dependencies on a url-based package
