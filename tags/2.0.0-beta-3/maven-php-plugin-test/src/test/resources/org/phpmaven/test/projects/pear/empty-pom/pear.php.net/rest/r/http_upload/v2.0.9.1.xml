 <n>**The first release in (exactly!) two years!**

- **Changes between 0.9.0 and 0.9.1: fixed md5 hashes in package.xml!***
- (antonio) Added support for both PHP &gt;= 4.2 and PHP 4.0-4.1
- (antonio) Fixed a lot of bugs
- (antonio, wenz) Fixed some localization strings
- (wenz) if only empty files are uploaded, an error message 
  is triggered 
- (wenz) added setChmod() method to change CHMOD of uploaded files (patch by Markus Tacker) 
- (cox, antonio, wenz) many minor fixes
- (cox) Error detection was enhanced, so you no longer need to
  check for PEAR::isError() in $upload-&gt;getFiles() or call
  $upload-&gt;isMissing(). Instead you'll
  get the error when do a check for $file-&gt;isError().

  Example:

   $upload = new HTTP_Upload('en');
   $file = $upload-&gt;getFiles('i_dont_exist_in_form_definition');
   if ($file-&gt;isError()) {
      die($file-&gt;getMessage());
   }

TODO:

- Move error class to a new file
- As PEAR in general requires now PHP 4.2, maybe drop BC compat in future</n>
