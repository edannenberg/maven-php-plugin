 <s>WebDAV Server Baseclass.</s>
 <d>RFC2518 compliant helper class for WebDAV server implementation.
</d>
 <da>2003-11-18 16:23:01</da>
 <n>almost all TODO features and issues for 1.0 are now implemented,
there might be some additional API cleanups in PROPFIND and PROPPATCH
and some small issues in the Fileserver example still exist

as soon as this is done i think the packe is ready for
a 1.0RC1 release

Starting with this release it is now possible to return 
streams from GET and PUT. IF you return a readable stream 
from GET or a writable stream from PUT the base class will
take care of any further action including HTTP header 
generation and handling of partial GETs and PUTs (if the
returned streams are seekable). 

The only things you should return in addition to an
appropriate open stream are the current size of the
resource in $options['size'] for both GET and PUT 
and the mimetype in $options['mimetype'] and modification 
date in $options['mtime'] for GET.</n>
