 <s>PHP_CodeSniffer tokenises PHP code and detects violations of a defined set of coding standards.</s>
 <d>PHP_CodeSniffer is a PHP5 script that tokenises and &quot;sniffs&quot; PHP code to detect violations of a defined set of coding standards. It is an essential development tool that ensures that your code remains clean and consistent. It can even help prevent some common semantic errors made by developers.</d>

 <n>- BC BREAK: Coding standards now require a class to be added so PHP_CodeSniffer can get information from them
  - Please read the end user docs for info about the new class required for all coding standards
- Coding standards can now include sniffs from other standards, or whole standards, without writing new sniff files
- PHP_CodeSniffer_File::isReference() now correctly returns for references in function declarations
- PHP_CodeSniffer_File::isReference() now returns false if you don't pass it a T_BITWISE_AND token
- PHP_CodeSniffer_File now stores the absolute path to the file so sniffs can check file locations correctly
- Fixed undefined index error in AbstractVariableSniff for variables inside an interface function definition
- Added MemberVarSpacingSniff to Squiz standard to enforce one-line spacing between member vars
- Add FunctionCommentThrowTagSniff to Squiz standard to check that @throws tags are correct
- Fixed problems caused by references and type hints in Squiz FunctionDeclarationArgumentSpacingSniff
- Fixed problems with errors not being thrown for some misaligned @param comments in Squiz FunctionCommentSniff
- Fixed badly spaced comma error being thrown for &quot;extends&quot; class in Squiz ClassDeclarationSniff
- Errors no longer thrown for class method names in Generic ForbiddenFunctionsSniff
- Errors no longer thrown for type hints in front of references in Generic UpperCaseConstantNameSniff
- Errors no longer thrown for correctly indented buffered lines in Squiz ScopeIndexSniff
- Errors no longer thrown for user-defined functions named as forbidden functions in Generic ForbiddenFunctionsSniff
- Errors no longer thrown on __autoload functions in PEAR ValidFunctionNameSniff
- Errors now thrown for __autoload methods in PEAR ValidFunctionNameSniff
- Errors now thrown if constructors or destructors have @return tags in Squiz FunctionCommentSniff
- Errors now thrown if @throws tags dont start with a capital and end with a full stop in Squiz FunctionCommentSniff
- Errors now thrown for invalid @var tag values in Squiz VariableCommentSniff
- Errors now thrown for missing doc comment in Squiz VariableCommentSniff
- Errors now thrown for unspaced operators in FOR loop declarations in Squiz OperatorSpacingSniff
- Errors now thrown for using ob_get_clean/flush functions to end buffers in Squiz OutputBufferingIndentSniff
- Errors now thrown for all missing member variable comments in Squiz VariableCommentSniff</n>
