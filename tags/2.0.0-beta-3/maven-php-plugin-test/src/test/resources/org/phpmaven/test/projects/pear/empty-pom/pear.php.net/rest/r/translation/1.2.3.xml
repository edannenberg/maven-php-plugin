 <s>Class for creating multilingual webistes.</s>
 <d>Class allows to store and retrieve all the strings on multilingual site in the database. Class connects to any database using PHP PEAR extension. The object should be created for every page. While creation all the strings connected with specific page and the strings connected with all the pages on the site are loaded into variable, so access to them is quite fast and does not overload database server connection.
