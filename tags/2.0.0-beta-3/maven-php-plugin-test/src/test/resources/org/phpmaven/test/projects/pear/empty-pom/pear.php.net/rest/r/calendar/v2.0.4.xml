 <s>A package for building Calendar data structures (irrespective of output)</s>
 <d>Calendar provides an API for building Calendar data structures. Using the simple iterator and it's &quot;query&quot; API, a user interface can easily be built on top of the calendar data structure, at the same time easily connecting it to some kind of underlying data store, where &quot;event&quot; information is being held.

It provides different calculation &quot;engines&quot; the default being based on Unix timestamps (offering fastest performance) with an alternative using PEAR::Date which extends the calendar past the limitations of Unix timestamps. Other engines should be implementable for other types of calendar (e.g. a Chinese Calendar based on lunar cycles).
