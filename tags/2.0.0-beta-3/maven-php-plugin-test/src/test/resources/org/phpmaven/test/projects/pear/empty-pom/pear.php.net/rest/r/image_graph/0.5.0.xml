 <s>A package for displaying (numerical) data as a graph/chart/plot.</s>
 <d>Image_Graph provides a set of classes that creates graphs/plots/charts based on (numerical) data.

Many different plot types are supported: Bar, line, area, step, impulse, scatter, radar, pie, map, candlestick, band, box &amp; whisker and smoothed line, area and radar plots.

The graph is highly customizable, making it possible to get the exact look and feel that is required.

The output is controlled by a driver mechanism, which facilitates easy output to many different output formats, amongst others, GD (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WBMP), PDF (using PDFLib), ShockWave Flash (using Ming) and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG).

Image_Graph is compatible with both PHP4 and PHP5 and can be used with both GD1 and GD2 (GD2 is recommended)

 <n>* Major change: removed Image_Graph_Driver and subclasses and uses Image_Canvas instead, which implies:
    - Image_Graph_Color is obsolete, removing dependency on Image_Color (however Image_Canvas still depends on Image_Color)
    - Fonts are simplified (all identified by name) and implemented using Image_Graph_Font class, removing Image_Graph_Font subclasses (only subclasses!), removing Fonts/ folder
    - Added dependency on Image_Canvas
    - Image/Graph/Config.php becoming obsolete since only IMAGE_GRAPH_SYSTEM_FONT_PATH was defined here. File kept for future purposes but not used.
    - TTF Fonts (which were most often used) keep BC in 99% of the cases by replacing the 'ttf_font' factory alias mapping to 'Image_Graph_Font' and adding a mapping for 'Image_Graph_Font_TTF' to 'Image_Graph_Font'. Only case not working is when user manually includes Image/Graph/Font/TTF.php and creates and instance using 'new', which should only very, very rarely be the case
    - BC break: If drivers were explicitly created before, they now have to be changed to Image_Canvas objects
* Added support for HTML image maps on line-, bar-, area-, smoothed line-, impulse-, band- and pie charts (more to come)
* Added 'tohtml' option for output directly in HTML using canvas and imagemap (if any)
* Added label option 'format' and 'dateformat' to Image_Graph_Axis to be able to format a label directly using sprintf() / date()
* Changed plus and cross markers to be outlined (by defalut) - visual improvement
* Added a star marker (Image_Graph_Marker_Star)
* Added legends to scatter/dot plots - the marker now shows in legends
* Performance optimization in Image_Graph_Axis_Category (with regards to heavy usage of array_search())
* Improved appearance of axis arrows
* Fixed Bug #4240 &quot;Pie graph - color difference between graph and legend&quot;
* Fixed Bug #4430 &quot;Call-time pass-by-reference has been deprecated&quot;
* Fixed Bug #4876 &quot;mis-type in code -&gt; undefined property&quot;
* Bugs fixed/Features added in Image_Canvas
    * Added Request #4451 &quot;Unable to define IMAGE_GRAPH_SYSTEM_FONT_PATH outside of Config.php&quot;
    * Fixed Bug #4484 &quot;SVG output problem with fill and alignment attributes of text&quot;
    * Fixed Bug #4586 &quot;Content type image/jpg does not recognized by IE&quot;</n>
