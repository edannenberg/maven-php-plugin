 <s>User authentication and permission management framework</s>
 <d>LiveUser is a set of classes for dealing with user authentication
and permission management. Basically, there are three main elements that
make up this package:
* The LiveUser class
* The Auth containers
* The Perm containers
The LiveUser class takes care of the login process and can be configured
to use a certain permission container and one or more different auth containers.
That means, you can have your users' data scattered amongst many data containers
and have the LiveUser class try each defined container until the user is found.
For example, you can have all website users who can apply for a new account online
on the webserver's local database. Also, you want to enable all your company's
employees to login to the site without the need to create new accounts for all of
them. To achieve that, a second container can be defined to be used by the LiveUser class.
You can also define a permission container of your choice that will manage the rights for
each user. Depending on the container, you can implement any kind of permission schemes
for your application while having one consistent API.
Using different permission and auth containers, it's easily possible to integrate
newly written applications with older ones that have their own ways of storing permissions
and user data. Just make a new container type and you're ready to go!
Currently available are containers using:
PEAR::DB, PEAR::MDB, PEAR::MDB2, PEAR::XML_Tree and PEAR::Auth.

 <n>- Docs for getUsers was updated to reflect that we removed the simple filtering
- Fixed auth to perm mapping (also taking into account the auth container name)
- Fix #2538 added LIVEUSER_ERROR_WRONG_CREDENTIALS as an error when credentials are wrong.
                  The factory method on failure now returns an array of the error stack
                  if there is one or false.
- Fix #2528 LiverUser::Factory calls PEAR::isError. The methods return false and not
  a PEAR_Error so the check is wrong
- Fix #1957 one to many boolean in the type array in getRights.
- Fix #2527 have raiseError in the admin class and change the calls from 
  PEAR::raiseError to LiveUser_Admin::raiseError.
- Fix #2568 LiveUser_Admin::setAdminAuthContainer() returns true on 
  failure</n>
