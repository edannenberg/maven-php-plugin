 <s>NNTP implementation</s>
 <d>Package for communication with NNTP/Usenet servers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Demo available at:
http://www.gehlsen.dk/software/php/pear/net_nntp/demo/

Announcement subscription available at:
http://freshmeat.net/projects/net_nntp/

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Net_NNTP handles the connection and protocol level commands (RFC977), including many non-standard commands (RFC2980).

Net_NNTP includes an user friendly API for intermediate user, who don't want to work directly at the command level. However, Net_NNTP does require some knowledge about the NNTP protocol (RFC 977), and general knowledge about email (RFC(2)822) and MIME (2045-2048), since any handling of both content and headers is left up to the user.

The protocol implementation does not parse the actual article data!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This package uses a rather conservative release cycle.

No feature is considered stable until documented via phpdoc code available via the pear website.

As in other open source projects even minor versions is used for stable releases, and odd minor versions is used for development releases...

The Net_NNTP_Protocol_Client class is considered internal and might be subject to API-changes - it is currently incomplete, but very functional and well tested.</d>
