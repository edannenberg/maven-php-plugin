 <s>Generate a &quot;Tag Cloud&quot; in HTML and visualize tags by their frequency.
Additionally visualizes each tag's age.</s>
 <d>This package can be used to generate tag clouds. The output is HTML and CSS.

A Tag Cloud is a visual representation of so-called &quot;tags&quot; or keywords, that do
have a different font size depending on how often they occur on the page/blog. A
less used synonym for a Tag Cloud that came up before Web 2.0 is the term
&quot;weightet list&quot;. Popular examples of Tag Clouds and their use can be found in
action at pages like Flickr, Del.icio.us and Technorati. A nice overview on what
a Tag Cloud can actually do can be found at WikiPedia:
http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_cloud

This package does not only visualize frequency, but also timeline infomation.
The newer the tag is, the deeper its color will be; older tags will have a
lighter color.

The main goal of &quot;HTML_TagCloud&quot; is to provide an easy to implement and
configureable Tag Cloud solution that is suitable for any PHP-based webapp.

Features:
 - set up each tag's name, URL, frequency, age
 - customizable colors
 - customizable font-sizes</d>
 <da>2008-03-05 06:07:46</da>
 <n>New features
 - Added ability to set up timeline colors for tags dynamically by setting up a
    latestColor and a earliestColor and the number of thresholds.
    (requires PEAR package &quot;Image_Color&quot;)
 - Added ability to set up multiple tag cloud per page by attaching a unique id
    to each tag cloud's individual css class identifiers
Fixed issues
 - Fixed issue with setting up basefonsize and fontsizerange on extending class
   (doesn't got recognized when instance isn't constructed with these values;
   so they were useless in most of the cases)</n>
