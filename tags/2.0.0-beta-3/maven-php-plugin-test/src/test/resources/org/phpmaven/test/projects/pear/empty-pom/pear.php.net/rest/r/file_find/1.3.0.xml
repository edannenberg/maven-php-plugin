 <s>A Class the facilitates the search of filesystems</s>
 <d>File_Find, created as a replacement for its Perl counterpart, also named 
File_Find, is a directory searcher, which handles, globbing, recursive 
directory searching, as well as a slew of other cool features.

 <n>Work towards stream support. This version doesn't try to normalize
slashes in returned result and thus it's output may be inconsistent
with of previous versions.

+ new object variable $this-&gt;dirsep to explicitly define directory
separator (forward slash by default)

- drop out &quot;use only native system slashes&quot; and &quot;replace double
slashes if any&quot; beautifiers which damage stream prefixes and stream
specific URLs

- minor comment fixes</n>
