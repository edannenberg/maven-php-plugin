 <s>sqlite MDB2 driver</s>
 <d>This is the SQLite MDB2 driver.
 
</d>
 <da>2006-08-21 14:28:57</da>
 <n>- fixed issue in tableInfo() that originates in getTableFieldDefinition() which
  led to returning incorrect type values (Bug #8291)
- added support for NULL columns in getTableFieldDefinition()
- added full support for alterTable() via emulation
- added support for primary key creation and dropping
- do not list empty contraints and indexes
- use information_schema in listTableFields() instead of selecting from the
  table since that does not work if the table is empty
- fixed handling of contraints in _getTableColumns()
- fixed primary key handling in alterTable(), createConstraint() and dropConstraint()
- do not set a default if type is a LOB (Request #8074)
- fixed handling return values when disable_query is set in _doQuery() and _execute()
- increased MDB2 dependency too 2.2.1

note:
- this driver only supports SQLite version 2.x databases
- the replace test fails because sqlite reports an incorrect affected rows
  value when no existing data was replaced
- the multi_query test failes because this is not supported by ext/sqlite
- the savepoint test failes because this is not supported by sqlite
- the case sensitive search test fails because this is not supported by SQLite
- the pattern escaping test fails because this is not supported by SQLite

open todo items:
- fix pattern escaping using GLOB instead of LIKE or create an register own implementation of LIKE</n>
