 <s>Logging utilities</s>
 <d>The Log framework provides an abstracted logging system.  It supports logging to console, file, syslog, SQL, mail, and mcal targets.  It also provides a subject - observer mechanism.

 <n>The Log classes no longer inherits from the PEAR base class.  Not including the PEAR base class gives us smaller, faster Log objects.

The Log_file class now registers its own destructor to ensure that the logfile is correctly closed upon shutdown.

A ZendEngine 1 incompatibility was introduced in the previous release.  This has been corrrected.</n>
