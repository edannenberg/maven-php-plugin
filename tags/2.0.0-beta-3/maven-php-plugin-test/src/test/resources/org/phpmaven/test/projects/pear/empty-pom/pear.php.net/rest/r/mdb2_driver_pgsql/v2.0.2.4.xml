 <n>- added support for length in integer and decimal columns
- removed ugly hack for quote parameter in quote() since it was insufficient
  (escaping also needs to be prevented)
- added support for out of order parameter binding in prepared queries
- reset row_limit and row_offset after calling prepare() just like we do for query() and exec()
- cosmetic fix (removed &quot;row_&quot; prefix from &quot;row_limit&quot; and &quot;row_offset&quot;)
- improved parsing in getServerInfo() (bug #6550)

open todo items:
- considering migrating away from OID's to bytea, since this is encourage
  since version 8 and is also what PDO expects, however there is no streaming
  API for bytea columns .. this needs to be done using manually chunked reads/writes</n>
