 <n>This is a major milestone release for PEAR.  In addition to several killer features,
  every single element of PEAR has a regression test, and so stability is much higher
  than any previous PEAR release, even with the beta label.

  New features in a nutshell:
  * full support for channels
  * pre-download dependency validation
  * new package.xml 2.0 format allows tremendous flexibility while maintaining BC
  * support for optional dependency groups and limited support for sub-packaging
  * robust dependency support
  * full dependency validation on uninstall
  * remote install for hosts with only ftp access - no more problems with
    restricted host installation
  * full support for mirroring
  * support for bundling several packages into a single tarball
  * support for static dependencies on a uri-based package
  * support for custom file roles and installation tasks

  Specific changes from 1.4.0b1:
  * configure options were not being prompted for packages like pecl/PDO
  * use file_get_contents() wherever possible in favor of fread($fp, filesize($file))
    as this is deprecated behavior and won't work with streams at all in PHP 5.1
  * fix CLI frontend in PHP 5.0+ with CGI version
  * fix Bug #5240: Unnecessary assign by reference in PEAR_ErrorStack
  * fix Bug #5285: Incorrect dependency on PEAR_RemoteInstall should be PEAR_RemoteInstaller
  * fix Bug #5322: Clean up docs and handling of exceptions</n>
