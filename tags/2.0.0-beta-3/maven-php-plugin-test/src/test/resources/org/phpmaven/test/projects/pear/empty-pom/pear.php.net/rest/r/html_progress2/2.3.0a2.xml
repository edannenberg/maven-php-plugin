HTML_Progress2 2.3.0 requires now minimum PHP version 4.3.0 to work.

* news
- all alpha releases of version 2.3.0 are related to request #3985: Ajax progress bar
- add PEAR::HTML_AJAX 0.5.0 as an optional dependency
- HTML_Progress2::getScript() method has a new (optional) parameter to handle
  custom HTML_Progress2 package installation.
  If you do not used PEAR installer, parameter #2 ($path) identify location of
  directory where to find the HTML_Progress2.js file.
  It will search first in PEAR/data dir, then in same directory where HTML_Progress2
  is installed or in your user dir ($path).
  DO NOT add a trailing directory separator at end of the path !

  Credit: on a cool idea of HTML_AJAX !
