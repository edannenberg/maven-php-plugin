 <n>* bugs
- fixed bug #8684 : Problem with generated JavaScript
- fixed &quot;examples/generatorcus.php&quot; to use new architecture with external stylesheet introduced on August 11, 2006.

* news (improved code)
- used now &quot;className&quot; property rather than &quot;visibility&quot;
and reduced div tags count used to build a progress bar (only 10 rather than 20 )
- apply more CS (space code indent, ...)
- add &quot;alt&quot; attribute to img html-tag to be more xhtml compliant
- JS function &quot;hideProgress&quot; lose its second parameter (no more needed)</n>
