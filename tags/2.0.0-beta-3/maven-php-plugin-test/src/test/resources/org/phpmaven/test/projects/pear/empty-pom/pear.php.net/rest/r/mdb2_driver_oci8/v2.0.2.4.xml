 <n>- added support for length in decimal columns
- removed ugly hack for quote parameter in quote() since it was insufficient
  (escaping also needs to be prevented)
- added support for out of order parameter binding in prepared queries
- tried to fix issues with lobs where the placeholder is not named like the field
- reset row_limit and row_offset after calling prepare() just like we do for query() and exec()
- rewrite queries for limit/offset (taken from ezc) instead of emulating
- cosmetic fix (removed &quot;row_&quot; prefix from &quot;row_limit&quot; and &quot;row_offset&quot;)
- now using INT by default instead of CHAR(1) for the boolean datatype (BC BREAK!)
- improved parsing in getServerInfo() (bug #6550)

open todo items:
- fix issues with lobs where the placeholder is not named like the field
- fix crash in _makeAutoincrement()
- handle autoincremement fields in alterTable()
- there are still a number of missing methods in the reverse and datatype module
- there are still severe stability issues due to ext/oci8, especially on windows
- ensure that all primary/unique/foreign key handling is only in the contraint methods</n>
