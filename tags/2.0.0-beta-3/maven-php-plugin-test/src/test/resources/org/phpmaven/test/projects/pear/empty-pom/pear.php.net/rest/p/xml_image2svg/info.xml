 <s>Image to SVG conversion</s>
 <d>The class converts images, such as of the format JPEG, PNG and GIF to a standalone SVG representation. The image is being encoded by the PHP native encode_base64() function. You can use it to get back a complete SVG file, which is based on a predefinded, easy adaptable template file, or you can take the encoded file as a return value, using the get() method. Due to the encoding by base64, the SVG files will increase approx. 30% in size compared to the conventional image.</d>
