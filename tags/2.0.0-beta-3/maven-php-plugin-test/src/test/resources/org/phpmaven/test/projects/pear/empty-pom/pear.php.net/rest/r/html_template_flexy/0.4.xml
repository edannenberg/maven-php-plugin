 <s>An extremely powerful Tokenizer driven Template engine</s>
 <d>HTML_Template_Flexy started it's life as a simplification of HTML_Template_Xipe, 
however in Version 0.2, It became one of the first template engine to use a real Lexer,
rather than regex'es, making it possible to do things like ASP.net or Cold Fusion tags. 
However, it still has a very simple set of goals.
- Very Simple API, easy to learn...
- Targeted at Object based systems - default behavior is to display object variables
- Designed to allow the documentation of available variables using PEAR standards, eg. PHPDoc comments around object variables
- Ability to edit the templates in WYSIWYG HTML editors, without breaking the tags
- Extremely Fast, for normal variables and looping (or blocks), both for designing and runtime.

Features:
- {variable} to echo $object-&gt;variable
- {method()} to echo $object-&gt;method();
- {foreach:var,key,value} to PHP foreach loops
- tag attributes FLEXY:FOREACH, FLEXY:IF for looping and conditional HTML inclusion
- {if:variable} to PHP If statement
- {if:method()} to PHP If statement
- {else:} and {end:} to close or alternate If statements
- FORM to HTML_QuickForms mapping
- replacement of INPUT, TEXTAREA and SELECT tags with HTML_QuickForm code
  use FLEXY:IGNORE to prevent replacements
- FLEXY:START/FLEXY:STARTCHILDREN tags to define where output starts/finishes
- support for urlencoded braces {} in HTML attributes.  
- docs temporarily at http://devel.akbkhome.com/peardoc2/package.html.html-template-flexy.html

 <n>Warning BC breaking release: 
  - It is likely that form code may break with this due to the quickform integration
  - likely issues: you will probably have to load the template and assign data to it
    using $template-&gt;setQuickForm($this);
    which will then expose $template-&gt;quickform as the template Object.
  
  

Bug fixes
  - fixed #literal# chopping bug (Yuri Dyakonov)
  - fixed XML/XHTML support (no more munging of cases)
  - fixed Fatal Error messages - with more details
  - fixed whitespace in doctype tags. (wierd lexer stuff)
  
  
  
Features
  - quickforms (3) integration added.
  - quickforms with multiple forms $flexyobj-&gt;quickforms[0.....]
  - Initial gettext/multilanguage support
  - support variable[12] as a valid variable name.
  - does syntax checking on form element names 
  - fixed {outputBody()} (no prefix var methods)
  - added url_rewrite for HREF and SRC tags - see example.ini for more details
  - added compileAll.php script for bulk compilation on servers that do not have
    write access to the directories they are serving off.
  - Added extra Option - nonHTML to not make tokens of HTML tags, and enable postprocessing 
    of compiled template to replace ?&gt;\n with ?&gt;\n\n (aimed at email templates)
  - Added extra Option - allowPHP to enable PHP code in template to be left alone. - defaults
    to off (eg. no PHP allowed) - 
  - added support for &lt;TAG IF=&quot;somevar.xxxx&quot; and 
    &lt;TAG  IF=&quot;somevar.method()&quot; maps to if (the test) &lt;TAG .....
  - handles elements with same name, like radio buttons  - although performing modifications on 
    them can be tricky..
    
  
While may thanks are owed to the many beta testers, special mention to Xavier 
for spotting some really annoying little bugs.</n>
