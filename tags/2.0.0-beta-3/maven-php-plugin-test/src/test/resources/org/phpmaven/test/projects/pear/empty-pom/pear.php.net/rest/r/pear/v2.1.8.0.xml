    restricted host installation
  * full support for mirroring
  * support for bundling several packages into a single tarball

  * PEAR_Common-&gt;infoFromTgzFile (use PEAR_PackageFile-&gt;fromTgzFile instead)
  * PEAR_Common-&gt;infoFromDescriptionFile (use PEAR_PackageFile-&gt;fromPackageFile instead)
  * PEAR_Common-&gt;infoFromString (use PEAR_PackageFile-&gt;fromXmlstring instead)
  * PEAR_Common-&gt;infoFromArray (use PEAR_PackageFile-&gt;fromAnyFile instead)
  * PEAR_Common-&gt;xmlFromInfo (use a PEAR_PackageFile_v* object's generator instead)
  * PEAR_Common-&gt;validatePackageInfo (use the validation of PEAR_PackageFile objects)
  * PEAR_Common-&gt;analyzeSourceCode (use a PEAR_PackageFile_v* object instead)
  * PEAR_Common-&gt;detectDependencies (use PEAR_Downloader_Package-&gt;detectDependencies instead)
  * PEAR_Common-&gt;buildProvidesArray (use PEAR_PackageFile_v1-&gt;_buildProvidesArray or
    PEAR_PackageFile_v2_Validator-&gt;_buildProvidesArray)

  PHP 4.4 and 5.1.6 are now the minimum PHP requirements, for brave souls
  pear upgrade -f PEAR will allow people with lower versions
  to upgrade to this release but no guarantees will be made that it will work properly.

  Support for XML RPC channels has been dropped - The only ones that used it
  (pear.php.net and pecl.php.net) have used the REST interface for years now.
  SOAP support also removed as it was only proof of concept.
