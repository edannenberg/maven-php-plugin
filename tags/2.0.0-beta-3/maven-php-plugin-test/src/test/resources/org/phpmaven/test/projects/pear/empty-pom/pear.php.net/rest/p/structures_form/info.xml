 <s>A package designed to make creating input forms easy for packages and applications regardless of their user interface.</s>
 <d>This package was designed to make it easy to add forms to all packages and
  applications regardless of the user interface. The package is modeled after
  HTML_QuickForm but cannot extend HTML_QuickForm because HTML_QuickForm is
  tied too tightly to HTML.
 
  PHP-GTK 2 forms are very similar to HTML forms. They consist of a handful of
  different input types and the data is submitted all together when a user 
  clicks the submit button. The difference is how the user values are
  submitted and stored. HTML forms submit data in an HTTP request using either
  GET or POST. PHP-GTK 2 forms call a callback which is then responsible for
  retrieving the values.</d>
