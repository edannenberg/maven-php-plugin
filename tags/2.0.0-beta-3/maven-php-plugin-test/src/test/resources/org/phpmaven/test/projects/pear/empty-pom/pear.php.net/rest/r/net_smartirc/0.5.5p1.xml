 <s>Net_SmartIRC is a PHP class for communication with IRC networks</s>
 <d>Net_SmartIRC is a PHP class for communication with IRC networks,
which conforms to the RFC 2812 (IRC protocol).
It's an API that handles all IRC protocol messages.
This class is designed for creating IRC bots, chats and show irc related info on webpages.

Full featurelist of Net_SmartIRC
-------------------------------------
- full object oriented programmed
- every received IRC message is parsed into an ircdata object
  (it contains following info: from, nick, ident, host, channel, message, type, rawmessage)
- actionhandler for the API
  on different types of messages (channel/notice/query/kick/join..) callbacks can be registered
- messagehandler for the API
  class based messagehandling, using IRC reply codes
- time events
  callbacks to methods in intervals
- send/receive floodprotection
- detects and changes nickname on nickname collisions
- autoreconnect, if connection is lost
- autoretry for connecting to IRC servers
- debugging/logging system with log levels (destination can be file, stdout, syslog or browserout)
- supports fsocks and PHP socket extension
- supports PHP 4.1.x to 4.3.2 (also PHP 5.0.0b1)
- sendbuffer with a queue that has 3 priority levels (high, medium, low) plus a bypass level (critical)
- channel syncing (tracking of users/modes/topic etc in objects)
- user syncing (tracking the user in channels, nick/ident/host/realname/server/hopcount in objects)
- when channel syncing is acticated the following functions are available:
  isJoined
  isOpped
  isVoiced
  isBanned
- on reconnect all joined channels will be rejoined, also when keys are used
- own CTCP version reply can be set

 <n>v0.5.5:
-------
fixes:
 - fixed a bug in _rawreceive()
   messages were parsed wrong which caused problems with kick reasons.
   (thx to sniper for reporting this).
 - fixed bug in message()
   CTCP ACTION messages had missing \001 at the end.
 - fixed a bug in quit(), which caused quit messages not to be sent to the server.
 - fixed reconnect() bug, it sent the channel join requests right after connect(),
   and tried to join a channel without a name.
 - fixes in ChannelSync code
   When a user joins a channel after SmartIRC, no WHO info is updated in the user object.
   Fixed wrong update of channel mode when rpl_channelmodeis received.
   Fixed bug in _mode() method, which caused wrong handling of mode changes.
   Topic updates are now tracked (thanks to sniper).
   Fixed bug which caused fatal errors with ChannelSync enabled
   (closes sf.net bug  #705269).
   Fixed bug in _event_mode(), unhandled modes were stored wrong.
   Fixed bug in _event_rpl_namreply(), which caused that the first char of the first nick
   of a namreply got cut (closes sf.net bug #747832).
 - fixed bug in _checktimer()
   Which caused problems when a timehandler is unregistered.
 - fixed _gettye()
   It wasn't recognizing SMARTIRC_TYPE_ACTION.
 - removed if(!$obj) check for newly created objects (closes PHP bug #24622),
   required for PHP 4.1.2 compatibility.

changes:
 - removed all irc commands from SmartIRC.php
   they have now their own file (SmartIRC/irccommands.php).
 - Net_SmartIRC_messagehandler class now extends Net_SmartIRC_irccommands.
 - removed the 1. parameter (&amp;$irc) of all message handlers, not needed anymore.
 - renamed class Net_SmartIRC_user to Net_SmartIRC_channeluser,
   added class Net_SmartIRC_ircuser.
 - added prefix _event to all message handlers (needed because of class restructuring).
 - tweaked filling of the ircdata objects.
 - log() now checks the passed debug level bitwise.
 - $data-&gt;message will be null instead of random garbage,
   if the IRC message has no colon (the message part),
 - All methods that depend on ChannelSync mode, checks if it's enabled.
 - Optimized the usage of time() for $this-&gt;_lastrx.
 - updated the URL of a SmartIRC based bot (atbs).
 - _loggedin is now set to false when the socket is dead,
   required for proper working  reconnect().
 - on a reconnect(), the logfile won't be overwritten anymore.
 - updated phpdoc tags.
 - all access to the channel array now uses strtolower() for the key.
 - fixed typo in function name setChannelSynching(),
   now it's called setChannelSyncing() with a BC wrapper.
 - removed all SMARTIRC_ prefixes for debug output.
 - changed isJoined($channel) to isJoined($channel, $nickname)
   for checking if the specified user is joined.
 - removed &quot;destructors&quot;, because they don't free the memory.

new:
 - added isOpped() isVoiced() isBanned().
 - added debug output and debug level for the messageparser.
 - reconnect() uses now the channel key if one exists.
 - added channel key syncing in _mode().
 - when an actionhandler message regex has a leading '/' then the regex is used as it is,
   this allows complex perl regex's.
 - added message type SMARTIRC_TYPE_CTCP_REQUEST and SMARTIRC_CTCTP_REPLY for more advanced CTCP.
 - added new log destinations SMARTIRC_NONE and SMARTIRC_BROWSEROUT
   (for firendly browserouput). When the script is called from a browser,
   the BROWSEROUT will automatic be used (closed sf.net bug #708155).
 - added error handling for socket_select() in _rawreceive().
 - added getMessage() to Net_SmartIRC_Error class.
 - added debug level for ChannelSync code (SMARTIRC_DEBUG_CHANNELSYNCING).
 - added filename and linenumber to debug output.
 - added key property to channel class.
 - added to all IRC commands optional $priority parameter with default value SMARTIRC_MEDIUM.
 - added isError() for more advanced errorhandling, needed for encapsulation.
 - added _isValidType() method, which checks for valid SMARTIRC_TYPE_* types.</n>
