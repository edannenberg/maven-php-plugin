TODO : Need to fix Regression Tests Suite

Changes since version 1.7.0b3 (2008-03-28)

* news
- Use PEAR::File_Find package 1.3.0 or greater to manage &quot;ignore_dirs&quot; and
  &quot;ignore_files&quot; easily (with ability to filter by regular expression).
- XML report structure change.
  Render is improve if PEAR::XML_Beautifier is available.
- XML report may now be filtered with help of --output-level switch.
- Values change for --output-level switch. Use now binary value (more easy to remember)
  2-&gt;Extension, 4-&gt;Constant, 8-&gt;Tokens, with always 1-&gt;Path-File + Version
  (Thanks to Stephan Wentz for his request)
- Add new switch --summarize to limit output to first line (summary)
  when parsing directory
  (Thanks to Stephan Wentz for his request)

Changes since version 1.7.0b1 (2008-03-17)

  not be considered as optional.

  ignore_functions_match  with -inm switch,
  ignore_extensions_match with -iem switch,
  ignore_constants_match  with -icm switch
- On CLI options files (see -in, -ie, -ic, -inm, -iem, -icm)
  allow to put line in comment with ; character (as in php.ini)
