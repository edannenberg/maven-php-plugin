 <s>A package for displaying (numerical) data as a graph/chart/plot.</s>
 <d>Image_Graph provides a set of classes that creates graphs/plots/charts based on (numerical) data.

Many different plot types are supported: Bar, line, area, step, impulse, scatter, radar, pie, map, candlestick, band, box &amp; whisker and smoothed line, area and radar plots.

The graph is highly customizable, making it possible to get the exact look and feel that is required.

The output is controlled by a driver mechanism, which facilitates easy output to many different output formats, amongst others, GD (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WBMP), PDF (using PDFLib), ShockWave Flash (using Ming) and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG).

Image_Graph is compatible with both PHP4 and PHP5 and can be used with both GD1 and GD2 (GD2 is recommended)

 <n>Added possibility to use arrays of the type $data[$id] = array('x' =&gt; $x, 'y' =&gt; $y) for easy data addition to a dataset
* Added use of 'null' y-values in line plots (normal and smoothed) causing a break in the line (instead of dropping to zero)
* Added possibility to make one legend use multiple plotareas
* Added grouping to drivers (currently only fully supported by SVG driver)
* Added axis padding (padding inside the plotarea)
* Added Image_Graph_Axis::setFixedSize() to allow for alignment of axis on different plotareas when in a layout
* Added possibility to use padding with overlayed legends to make legend _not_ display fx. on-top of y-axis
* Added/improved support for multi line text using GD drivers
* Added support for antialiasing images when using GD (GD built in method)
* Implemented simple shadows (and removed shadow images from distribution)
* Fixed bug #3346 &quot;double as data&quot;
* Fixed a problem with normal multi-data bar charts not displaying expected bar width
* Fixed problem with legends when overlayed
* Fixed axis not displaying labels after resetting driver
* Fixed problem in SVG driver with vertical texts
* Fixed a problem with line axis marker on a secondary y-axis displaying vertically instead of horizontally
* Fixed problem with logarithmic axis not scaling properly
* Changed the way coordinates are calculated when adding titles to non-layout objects
* Changed which changes API causing minor BC breaks
	- Renamed Image_Graph_Plot_Bar::barWidth() to Image_Graph_Plot_Bar::setBarWidth()
	- Renamed Image_Graph_Plot_Bar::spacing() to Image_Graph_Plot_Bar::setSpacing()
	- Removed Image_Graph_Layout_Plotarea, it being completely obsolete with introduction of Image_Graph_Axis::setTitle()
* Updated header comment blocks to conform to new standards as specified by RFC
* Performance optimizations</n>
