 <s>Class to represent matrices and matrix operations</s>
 <d>Matrices are represented as 2 dimensional arrays of numbers. 
This class defines methods for matrix objects, as well as static methods 
to read, write and manipulate matrices, including methods to solve systems 
of linear equations (with and without iterative error correction).
Requires the Math_Vector package.
For running the unit tests you will need PHPUnit version 0.6.2 or older.

 <n>Fixed some bugs in matrix multiplication reported by John Pye
(john@curioussymbols.com) and Marcel Brunner (marcel@palmer.li).
Fixed some minor documentation incosistencies.

Modified the setData() method to accept a Math_Matrix object or
an array of arrays of numbers.
Added the setZeroThreshold() and getZeroThreshold() to set and get the
value used as upper bound to minimize round-off errors.
Added also two static methods to generate famous matrices:
Math_Matrix::makeHilbert() for a square Hilber matrix, and 
Math_Matrix::makeHankel() for m by n Hankel matrix.
Reorganized the directories to comply to the current directory organization
proposal.
It is recommended to uninstall the older version of Math_Matrix (and
Math_Vector) before installing this new release to avoid lingering files
(there is also a new release of Math_Vector):
$ pear uninstall Math_Matrix Math_Vector
$ pear install Math_Vector
$ pear install Math_Matrix
Included explicitely the optional dependency on the PHPUnit package version
0.6.2 or older, as current versions of that package need PHP5.</n>
