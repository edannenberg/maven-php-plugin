 <s>A tabular structure that contains a record set of data for paging and sorting purposes.</s>
 <d>This package offers a toolkit to render out a datagrid in HTML format as well as
many other formats such as an XML Document, an Excel Spreadsheet, an XUL Document and more.
It also offers paging and sorting functionallity to limit the data that is presented and processed.
This concept is based on the .NET Framework DataGrid control and works very well with database and XML result sets.</d>

#                 WARNING - BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES                  #
#                                                                        #
# The Structures_DataGrid::renderer property is not public anymore. It   #
# is now required to use the Structures_DataGrid::getRenderer() method   #
# in order to access the renderer object.                                #
#                                                                        #
# Arguments for column formatters are not available anymore in the first #
# parameter of self-defined formatter functions. There is a new second   #
# parameter which holds these arguments (see also below, request #6720). #
# If you want to have the old behaviour (i.e. all arguments in the array #
# of the first parameter), just add the following line                   #
#     $_STRUCTURES_DATAGRID['column_formatter_BC'] = true;               #
# before adding your columns to the datagrid.                            #
#                                                                        #
# Adding or removing single records via Structures_DataGrid::addRecord() #
# and Structures_DataGrid::dropRecord() isn't possible anymore.          #

#                               ATTENTION                                #
#                                                                        #
# All drivers (i.e. all DataSources and all Renderers) have been         #
# unbundled from Structures_DataGrid and are now available as separate   #
# PEAR packages.                                                         #
#                                                                        #
# Therefore, to run your scripts, you have to install some of these new  #
# packages as well. For example, most users will need to install the     #
# package Structures_DataGrid_Renderer_HTMLTable.                        #
#                                                                        #
# The installation of *all* DataSources is possible via:                 #
#   pear install Structures_DataGrid-beta#datasources                    #
# The installation of *all* Renderers is possible via:                   #
#   pear install Structures_DataGrid-beta#renderers                      #

BUGS:

- bug #4415: example files were installed in the package directory, now they
  will be installed into [PEAR-DOC-DIR]/Structures_DataGrid/docs/examples/
- bug #5858: removed @ before include() in DataSource.php (could crash silently)           
- bug #6624: column formatters using class names didn't handle parameters and
  class methods at the same time

FEATURE REQUESTS:

- requests #5758 and #7927: new parameters for Structures_DataGrid_Column::formatter()
  callback: 'fieldName', 'columnName', 'orderBy', 'attribs', 'currRow', 'currCol'
- request #5859: the rendering layer has gone through a long refactoring
  process and a new and flexible renderer driver interface has been
  implemented
- request #6621: new method getColumnByName() that returns a reference to
  a column object
- request #6720: arguments for column formatters can now be added via the (new)
  seventh column constructor (for example, you can now add arrays as arguments)

OTHER FIXES AND CHANGES:

- all DataSource and Renderer drivers have been unbundled
- new DataSource drivers: DBTable, DBQuery and MDB2
- query building:
  The query building process has been optimized, and is now more
  flexible due to the use of http_build_query(). 
- custom rendering containers:
  The containers that rendering drivers use to do their job, such as 
  HTML_Table, Spreadsheet_Excel_Writer, etc. can now be instantiated
  and customized by the user. They are then passed to the rendering
  driver with new methods such as Structures_DataGrid::fill() or 
  Structures_DataGrid_Renderer_*::setContainer().
- new fill() method:
  This method is meant to be to renderers what bind() is to datasources.
  It accepts a &quot;rendering container&quot; object (where bind() accepts a 
  &quot;datasource container&quot;) which it fills with data. No data is output
  during this process. It is up to the user to decide what to do with 
  the container once it's been filled up.
- sortable and unsortable fields:
  Better support for the $orderBy parameter of the column constructor:
  if it is null, then the corresponding column is considered unsortable,
  which is taken into account by various renderer drivers (HTMLTable, XUL, 
  etc.)
- new rendering driver: Structures_DataGrid_Renderer_HTMLSortForm</n>
