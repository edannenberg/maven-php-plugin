 <s>Swiss-army knive for reading and writing XML files. Creates XML files from data structures and vice versa.</s>
 <d>XML_Serializer serializes complex data structures like arrays or object as XML documents.
This class helps you generating any XML document you require without the need for DOM.
Furthermore this package can be used as a replacement to serialize() and unserialize() as it comes with a matching XML_Unserializer that is able to create PHP data structures (like arrays and objects) from XML documents, if type hints are available.
If you use the XML_Unserializer on standard XML files, it will try to guess how it has to be unserialized. In most cases it does exactly what you expect it to do.
Try reading a RSS file with XML_Unserializer and you have the whole RSS file in a structured array or even a collection of objects, similar to XML_RSS.

Since version 0.8.0 the package is able to treat XML documents similar to the simplexml extension of PHP 5.

 <n>XML_Serializer:
- Allow the use of '#default' whenever one wants to specify an option for any other key
- fixed bug #4575 for real: XML_Serializer now expects __sleep() to return an array of property names
XML_Unserializer:
- Added new IGNORE_KEYS option to specify a list of tags which will not be unserialized using their names as keys
- Added new GUESS_TYPE option to automatically convert the data to the best matching type
- Allow COMPLEXTYPE to be an array to be able to unserialize to arrays or objects
- Allow the use of '#default' whenever one wants to specify an option for any other tag</n>
