 <n>This is a quick fix to quoting problems in pgsql.
As MDB doesn't support all needed quoting methods for now it's not possible to use
any reserved words (key, order, group,...) for column names with MDB.
As soon as MDB also supports this it should work,
Please test it as much as possible while I am now finally will finish the docs.
Please file bugs using the great bug reporting system on pear.php.net.
If no further bugs are found this branch will be turned to stable. 

- Fixed Bug #1114: bug fix 561 flawed; single-quoting fields errors in pgsql reported by Andy Crain
+ The TreeMenu output driver now supports all params supported by PEAR::HTML_TreeMenu</n>
