 <s>PEAR_PackageFileManager2 takes an existing package.xml file and updates it with a new filelist and changelog</s>
 <d>This package revolutionizes the maintenance of PEAR packages.  With a few parameters,
the entire package.xml is automatically updated with a listing of all files in a package.
Features include
 - manages the new package.xml 2.0 format in PEAR 1.4.0
 - can detect PHP and extension dependencies using PHP_CompatInfo
 - reads in an existing package.xml file, and only changes the release/changelog
 - a plugin system for retrieving files in a directory.  Currently four plugins
   exist, one for standard recursive directory content listing, one that
   reads the CVS/Entries files and generates a file listing based on the contents
   of a checked out CVS repository, one that reads Subversion entries files, and
   one that queries a Perforce repository.
 - incredibly flexible options for assigning install roles to files/directories
 - ability to ignore any file based on a * ? wildcard-enabled string(s)
 - ability to include only files that match a * ? wildcard-enabled string(s)
 - ability to manage dependencies
 - can output the package.xml in any directory, and read in the package.xml
   file from any directory.
 - can specify a different name for the package.xml file</d>
