 <s>Class for multilingual applications management.</s>
 <d>This class provides an easy way to retrieve all the strings for a multilingual
site from a data source (i.e. db).
The following containers are provided, more will follow:
- PEAR::DB
- PEAR::MDB
- PEAR::MDB2
- gettext
- PEAR::DB_DataObject (experimental)
It is designed to reduce the number of queries to the db, caching the results when possible.
An Admin class is provided to easily manage translations (add/remove a language, add/remove a string).
Currently, the following decorators are provided:
- CacheLiteFunction (for file-based caching)
- CacheMemory (for memory-based caching)
- DefaultText (to replace empty strings with their keys)
- Lang (resort to fallback languages for empty strings)
- SpecialChars (replace html entities with their hex codes)
</d>

 <n>- BC break! Run the example to see what's new
- refactoring in progress:
  added a Decorator class and some subclasses to control
  the output (now you can set a stack of fallback languages,
  a filter to deal with empty strings, one or more cache layers...)
- improved gettext support (thanks to Michael Wallner)
- added gettext admin class
- fixes in the db admin classes
- when adding a new string, if it matches one already in the db,
  the old one is replaced by the new one.
- added a MDB2 container
- added a DB_DataObject container (by Alan Knowles)</n>
