 <s>An SQL parser</s>
 <d>This class is primarily an SQL parser, written with influences from a variety of sources (mSQL, CPAN's SQL-Statement, mySQL). It also includes a tokenizer (lexer) class and a reimplementation of the ctype extension in PHP.</d>

 <n>QA release
    * Fixed bug in parsing default function arguments

    * Dialects can pass parser and lexer options to change behavior
      beyond just keywords.
    * Added lexer option to accept idents starting with a number
