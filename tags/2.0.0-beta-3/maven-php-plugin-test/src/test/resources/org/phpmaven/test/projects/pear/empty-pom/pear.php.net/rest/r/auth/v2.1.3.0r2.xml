 <s>Creating an authentication system.</s>
 <d>The PEAR::Auth package provides methods for creating an authentication
system using PHP.

Currently it supports the following storage containers to read/write
the login data:

* All databases supported by the PEAR database layer
* All databases supported by the MDB database layer
* All databases supported by the MDB2 database layer
* Plaintext files
* LDAP servers
* POP3 servers
* IMAP servers
* vpopmail accounts
* RADIUS
* SAMBA password files
* SOAP

 <n>* Moved login screen generation code to Auth/Frontend/Html.php 
  In the future the frontend will be configurable.
* Implemented support for Challenge / Responce password authenthication
  have to enable advanced security $auth-&gt;setAdvancedSecurity
  will work only with DB container and cryptType = none|md5
* Implemented setAllowLogin to control which pages are allowed to perform login, 
  to preservce BC. Previusly the showLogin flag was used to control this - yavo
* Implmented lazy loading for the storage constructor, constructor is only created when needed
  to make Auth more lightweight (this might be adding a bit more overhead to login and usermanagement functions)
* Removed include of PEAR, was not used anywhare in Auth.php
* Created a new storage container DBLite same as DB but with the user manipulation functions removed (50% smaller)
* Added a new method staticCheckAuth which can be called statically with only the auth options
* Auth::importGlobalVariable method was removed and replaced by references to global variables
* Removed all calls to $session[$this-&gt;_sessionName], made local reference session point to that instead
* Changed call_user_func to call_user_func_array for the callbacks, to avoid using @ for passing variables by reference
* Code Cleanup, removed most vi comments</n>
