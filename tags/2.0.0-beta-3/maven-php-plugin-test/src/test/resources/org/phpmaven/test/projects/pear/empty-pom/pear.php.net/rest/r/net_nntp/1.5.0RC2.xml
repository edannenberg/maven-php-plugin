 <s>NNTP implementation</s>
 <d>PEAR's package for communication with NNTP/Usenet servers.
Net_NNTP handles the connection and protocol level commands (RFC977), including many commonly implemented non-standard commands (RFC2980).
Net_NNTP includes an unserfriendly API for intermediate user, who don't want to work directly at the command level. However, Net_NNTP does require some knowlege about the NNTP protocol (RFC 977), and general knowledge about email (RFC(2)822) and MIME (2045-2048), since any handling of both content and headers is left up to the user!
The protocol implementation does not parse the actual article data, but at the command level it splits returned data at protocol specified boundaries where appropriate.</d>

 <n>+ Fix limited buffer for large replies from server (bug# 18875)
+ Fix NNTP injection vulnerability (reported by Brendan Coles, itsecuritysolutions.org)
+ Fix XXS vulnerability in demo (reported by Brendan Coles, itsecuritysolutions.org)
+ Added support for STARTTLS encryption
+ Use PHP's streams instead of Net_NNTP (to allow easy TLS encryption and future on demand data compressed)
+ Improved logging with notices for most commands
+ Added warning about feof() defect in PHP 5.2.11 (bug #49706)
+ Fix usage of deprecated split() (bug #17417 and #17783)
+ Fix for large groups on 32 bit systems: Article numbers are no longer cast into integers, but passed on directly from the server as strings (bug #17689). This _could_ possibly have implications and should considered a possible backward compatibility breakage, but is thought to be acceptable, since PHP is expected to cast into integers/floats as needed...</n>
