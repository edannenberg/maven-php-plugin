 <s>Database table abstraction library</s>
 <d>Table browsing objects allow your code to handle any database table in an
abstract way. By freeing your code from the database details it is possible 
for you to build generic data reporting or manipulation functions.

Put another way, if you really hate using sql in your code, having to piece 
together bits of sql to make queries...this library gives you an alternative.

Currently only the single table browser is implemented. If you need to work 
with data that spans multiple tables, you can build a table view as this
library works with them as well.</d>
