 <n>First released package in PEAR

Changes since last PEPr release:
* Added support for image maps - a separate canvas (Image_Canvas_ImageMap) has been created to accomplish this
* Added support for antialiasing images when using GD (both using native GD method and Image_Graph own implementation)
* Added support for multi line texts    
* Added a toHtml() method for to easy facilitate including canvas in HTML (this includes the associated image map, if any)
* Added line ends - only supported in GD canvases currently and not on polygons (yet!)</n>
