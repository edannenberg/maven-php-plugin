 <n>This release is primarily a coding standard clean-up before the 1.3.0 final
release.

In addition the following improvements to the LDAP Container where supplied
by Hugues Peeters &lt;hugues.peeters@claroline.net&gt;.
 * Changed default attrformat to AUTH so that loaded attributes are
   presented in the same format as other backends provide.
 * Added compatibility support to 1.2 style configuration options
 * Attributes option now accepts a comma seperated string as well as
   as array the same as db_fields in the DB, MDB and MDB2 backends.

Finally there are additional checks that the relevant PHP module is loaded
when loading the IMAP and VPOPMail Containers.</n>
