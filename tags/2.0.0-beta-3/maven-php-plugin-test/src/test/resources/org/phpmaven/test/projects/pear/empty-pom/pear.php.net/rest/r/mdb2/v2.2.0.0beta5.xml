 <s>database abstraction layer</s>
 <d>PEAR MDB2 is a merge of the PEAR DB and Metabase php database abstraction layers.

Note that the API will be adapted to better fit with the new php5 only PDO
before the first stable release.

It provides a common API for all support RDBMS. The main difference to most
other DB abstraction packages is that MDB2 goes much further to ensure
portability. Among other things MDB2 features:
* An OO-style query API
* A DSN (data source name) or array format for specifying database servers
* Datatype abstraction and on demand datatype conversion
* Portable error codes
* Sequential and non sequential row fetching as well as bulk fetching
* Ability to make buffered and unbuffered queries
* Ordered array and associative array for the fetched rows
* Prepare/execute (bind) emulation
* Sequence emulation
* Replace emulation
* Limited Subselect emulation
* Row limit support
* Transactions support
* Large Object support
* Index/Unique support
* Module Framework to load advanced functionality on demand
* Table information interface
* RDBMS management methods (creating, dropping, altering)
* RDBMS independent xml based schema definition management
* Reverse engineering schemas from an existing DB
* Full integration into the PEAR Framework
* PHPDoc API documentation

 <n>Warning: this release features numerous BC breaks to make the MDB2 API be as
similar as possible as the ext/pdo API! The next release is likely to also break
BC for the same reason. Check php.net/pdo for information on the pdo API.

- refactored LOB support (BC breaks)
- moved all drivers into separate packages MDB2_Driver_* (BC break)
- bindParam() and bindColumn() are now 1-indexed (BC break)
- removed special handling for day light saving time (bug #4341) (BC break)
- ensure SQL injection protection in all _quote() methods
  (was missing in some decimal, float, time, date and timestamp implementations)
- renamed getRowCount() to rowCount() for PDO compliance (BC break)
  (doesnt take into account the offset anymore)
- added new quote() parameter to remove quotes (ugly hack will get cleaned up)
- renamed execute() to _execute() since common provides some common functionality via execute()
- fixed some issues regarding limit/offset in prepared statements
- fixed bug in _assignBindColumns() when using associative fetches
- support numeric and string keys in types array for prepared queries
- call trigger error if __call() is unable to find a method in any of the modules
- work around php5 bugs in the test suite</n>
