 <s>Provides a c-client backend for webmail.</s>
 <d>Mail_IMAP provides a flexible API for connecting to and retrieving mail from mailboxes using the IMAP, POP3 or NNTP mail protocols. Connection to a mailbox is acheived through the c-client extension to PHP (http://www.php.net/imap). Meaning installation of the c-client extension is required to use Mail_IMAP.

Mail_IMAP can be used to retrieve the contents of a mailbox, whereas it may serve as the backend for a webmail application or mailing list manager.  Since Mail_IMAP is an abstracted object, it allows for complete customization of the UI for any application.

***NOTE***
Mail_IMAPv2 is currently available. Mail_IMAPv2 is far more extensible, has far fewer bugs than Mail_IMAP 1, and is *not* backward compatible with Mail_IMAP 1. Any new developement should use Mail_IMAPv2.</d>
