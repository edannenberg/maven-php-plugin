 <s>The add-on to HTML_QuickForm package that allows building of multipage forms</s>
 <d>The package is essentially an implementation of a PageController pattern.
Architecture:
* Controller class that examines HTTP requests and manages form values persistence across requests.
* Page class (subclass of QuickForm) representing a single page of the form.
* Business logic is contained in subclasses of Action class.
Cool features:
* Includes several default Actions that allow easy building of multipage forms.
* Includes usage examples for common usage cases (single-page form, wizard, tabbed form).

 <n>Fixed bug #8687: defaults for checkboxes and multiselects were not correctly
applied in non-modal forms if the user haven't seen the page containing them.</n>
