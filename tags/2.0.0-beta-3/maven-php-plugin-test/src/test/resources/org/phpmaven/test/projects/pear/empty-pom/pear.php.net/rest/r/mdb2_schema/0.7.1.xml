 <s>XML based database schema manager</s>
 <d>PEAR::MDB2_Schema enables users to maintain RDBMS independant schema
files in XML that can be used to create, alter and drop database entities
and insert data into a database. Reverse engineering database schemas from
existing databases is also supported. The format is compatible with both
PEAR::MDB and Metabase.</d>

 <n>- Package converted to version 2
- compareDefinition() was trying to update non-changing id field (Bug #8820)
- for a moment &lt;default&gt; should be always parsed as string, no matter the field
  type. this behavior may change in the future.
- undefined method MDB2_Schema::quoteIdentifier() (Bug #9172)
- added support for explicit NULL (&lt;null&gt;&lt;/null&gt;)
- &lt;value&gt;&lt;/value&gt; is now correctly being parsed as an empty string
- fixed internal bug in Parser that was introduced in revision 1.46 (Bug #9435)
- MDB2_Schema_Parser::setData() has been removed
- MDB2_Schema_Validate::validateDataField() is validating field data again
  (Bug #9181)
- updated reserved keywords of ibase
- updated XML Schema documentation
- updated XML Schema example
- added a new test case to isBoolean() (empty string)
- released the very first approach of the new parser that makes usage of
  XML_Serializer (alternative parser)

open todo items:
- Make MDB2_Schema loadable via MDB2_Driver_Common::loadModule() (Bug #8270)
- Add ability to define variables inside the schema (like a version number)
- Allow simple if statements that mean that anything enclosed is only executed
  if it meets certain criterias based on that version number (or some other
  variable). This would enable people to add DML statements that are only
  executed when updating from a specific version.
- Modularize Writer code or remake it
- Add specific error codes for Validate class
- Add support for ORDER clauses on UPDATEs (to resolve the duplicate key 
  problem)
- Update description.schema.xml
- Document how to use the API
- Create unit test for comparedefinitions()
- Create unit test for initializetable()
- Create unit test to compare the expected array definition with what is parsed
- HTML entities aren't being parsed correctly
- Add optional support for scale in decimal fields
- Improve validateDataFieldValue() to validate &lt;column&gt;
- Provide more info on MDB2_Schema_Validate errors (output parsed value and expected value)
- Views support
- Foreign keys support
- Fulltext index support</n>
