 <s>An SQL Builder, Object Interface to Database Tables</s>
 <d>DataObject performs 2 tasks:
  1. Builds SQL statements based on the objects vars and the builder methods.
  2. acts as a datastore for a table row.
  The core class is designed to be extended for each of your tables so that you put the
  data logic inside the data classes.
  included is a Generator to make your configuration files and your base classes.

 <n>Major bug fix release, Minor features added.  
  
  
Bug Fixes:
  #1559 - __FUNCTION__ remove, so dependancy on php 4.2 may still be valid.
  #1595 - regex include/exclude working correctly (Thanks to Stephane Gully)
  #1664 - configuration line links_{databasename} now available 
  #1726 - enable orderby and limit can be used with delete()   
  #1697 - prevent generator from adding an extra line created after definition.
  #1704 - update only adds null when the column is not marked 'not null'
  #1778 - toArray() returns a merge of defined table and actual results
  #1828 - Generator will die, if tableinfo is not supported.      
  #1833 - links() now returns an empty array (no links) or null (no links.ini)
      so it can be used generically with : $ar = (array) $do-&gt;links();
  #1835 - getLinks, getLink etc. now use -&gt;links(), so you can define your
      own links() to return table links, rather than use links.ini files.
  #1923 - removed all @ silencers, and replace with empty/isset.
  #1935 - selectAs() - removed double quoteIdentifiers
  #2068 - workaround for DB bug, postgres nextval() being rawurlencoded
  #1980 - logic error when using quoteIdentifiers
  
Changes:
  * DebugLevel(1) now displays native errors from database when queries fail.
  * Result Field names now stored seperately from Result Object
  * free() method added, to clean up memory instantly, if you are doing alot of queries.
      = Cleans Result Fields, Result Object, NumRows returned in Connection object.
  * include path is used to do file hunting if factory fails to find file.
  * DB is lazy loaded on connection.b</n>
