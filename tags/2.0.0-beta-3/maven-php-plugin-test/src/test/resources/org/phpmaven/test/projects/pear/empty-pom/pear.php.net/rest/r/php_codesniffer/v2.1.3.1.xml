 <s>PHP_CodeSniffer tokenises PHP, JavaScript and CSS files and detects violations of a defined set of coding standards.</s>
 <d>PHP_CodeSniffer is a PHP5 script that tokenises PHP, JavaScript and CSS files to detect violations of a defined coding standard. It is an essential development tool that ensures your code remains clean and consistent. It can also help prevent some common semantic errors made by developers.</d>

 <n>- All report file command line arguments now work with relative paths (request #17240)
- The extensions command line argument now supports multi-part file extensions (request #17227)
- Added report type --report=hgblame to show number of errors/warnings committed by authors in a Mercurial repository
    -- Has the same functionality as the svnblame report
    -- Thanks to Ben Selby for the patch
- Added T_BACKTICK token type to make detection of backticks easier (request #18799)
- Added pattern matching support to Generic ForbiddenFunctionsSniff
    -- If you are extending it and overriding register() or addError() you will need to review your sniff
- Namespaces are now recognised as scope openers, although they do not require braces (request #18043)
- Added new ByteOrderMarkSniff to Generic standard (request #18194)
  -- Throws an error if a byte order mark is found in any PHP file

- PHP_Timer output is no longer included in reports when being written to a file (request #18252)
  -- Also now shown for all report types if nothing is being printed to the screen
- Generic DeprecatedFunctionSniff now reports functions as deprecated and not simply forbidden (request #18288)
- PHPCS now accepts file contents from STDIN (request #18447)
  -- Example usage: cat temp.php | phpcs [options]  -OR-  phpcs [options] &lt; temp.php
  -- Not every sniff will work correctly due to the lack of a valid file path
- PHP_CodeSniffer_Exception no longer extends PEAR_Exception (request #18483)
  -- PEAR_Exception added a requirement that PEAR had to be installed
  -- PHP_CodeSniffer is not used as a library, so unlikely to have any impact

  - Should fix bug #18949 : Call to private method from static
- PEAR ClassDeclaration sniff now supports indentation checks when using the alternate namespace syntax
  - PEAR.Classes.ClassDeclaration.SpaceBeforeBrace message now contains 2 variables instead of 1
  - Sniff allows overriding of the default indent level, which is set to 4
  - Fixes bug #18933 : Alternative namespace declaration syntax confuses scope sniffs
- Fixed bug #18465 : &quot;self::&quot; does not work in lambda functions
  -- Also corrects conversion of T_FUNCTION tokens to T_CLOSURE, which was not fixing token condition arrays
