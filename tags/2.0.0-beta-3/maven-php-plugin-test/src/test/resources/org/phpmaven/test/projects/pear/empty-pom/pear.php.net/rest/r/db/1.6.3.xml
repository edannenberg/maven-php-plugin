 <s>Database Abstraction Layer</s>
 <d>DB is a database abstraction layer providing:
* an OO-style query API
* portability features that make programs written
   for one DBMS work with other DBMS's
* a DSN (data source name) format for specifying
   database servers
* prepare/execute (bind) emulation for databases
   that don't support it natively
* a result object for each query response
* portable error codes
* sequence emulation
* sequential and non-sequential row fetching as
   well as bulk fetching
* formats fetched rows as associative arrays,
   ordered arrays or objects
* row limit support
* transactions support
* table information interface
* DocBook and PHPDoc API documentation

DB layers itself on top of PHP's existing
database extensions.  The currently supported
extensions are:
dbase, fbsql, interbase, informix,
msql, mssql, mysql, mysqli,
oci8, odbc, pgsql, sqlite and sybase.

DB is compatible with both PHP 4 and PHP 5.

(danielc)

- common:
Fix notice caused by passing invalid $col to
getCol().  (danielc)

- mysql, mysqli, oci8:
Add error maping for failure of update/delete
due to foreign key constraint.  (danielc)

- mysqli:
IT NOW WORKS!  (danielc)

- tests:
Make test suite work for installed packages.
Already worked for CVS checkouts.  (danielc)

- tests:
db_error.phpt and db_error2.phpt now pass
when using PHP 5.  (danielc)
