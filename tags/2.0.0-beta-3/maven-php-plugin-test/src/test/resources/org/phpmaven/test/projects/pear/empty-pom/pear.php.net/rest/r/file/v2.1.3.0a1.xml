 <n>* Fixed Bug #5045 File::stripTrailingSeparators should not rtrim the path &quot;/&quot; on linux (mike)
* Fixed Bug #5464 fwrite returns false but file checks for -1 (mike)
* Request   #6316 File_CSV doesn't allow to read data from a file and after write data to the same file (helgi)
* Request   #7559 File_Util::isIncludable() (file exists within include_path) (mike)
* Fixed Bug #7789 File::_getFilePointer() cannot return a reference (mike)
* Added more CSV tests (helgi)
* Moving the PHP dep to 4.3 to follow PEAR, adding dep on PEAR 1.5.0 to be sure people run proper PEAR version (helgi)
* File_CSV: add b mode to fopen in disoverFormat for portability (http://www.php.net/fopen)
* Fixed Bug #6447 Package will not install (helgi)
* Fixed Bug #5553 File_CSV should detect an occurance of delimeter in field and escape (helgi)
* Fixed Bug #4792 File_CSV: Last column keeps line breaks (helgi)
* Fixed Bug #10721 File_CSV: discoverFormat() can't handle large files (ieure)
* Fixed Bug #10883 Test 019 mislabeled
* Fixed Bug #10882 Tests fail (helgi / cipri)
* File_CSV: discoverFormat now uses the first 30 lines of the file. (helgi)
* File_CSV: supports reading =&quot;&quot; quoting, i.e. Excel only way of being smart with items starting with 00 and spaces and such (helgi)
* File_CSV: Now handles headers, pass header = true in the config for it to process it, we recommend reading like this:
$data = array();
File_CSV::read($file, $conf);
while ($res = File_CSV::read($file, $conf)) {
    $data[] = $res;
}

Note the first read call outside the while loop, it's because we don't want to include the header in the final data since
the first read gives that back just in case someone needs to do something else with those headers.
Passing this csv and the correct config:
header,body,foot
I'm a little header,this is my teapot,can't be!

Will give you this:
Array
(
    [0] =&gt; Array
        (
            [header] =&gt; I'm a little header
            [body] =&gt; this is my teapot
            [foot] =&gt; can't be!
        )

)

detection of headers will never be added since CSV has no standard for defining what is a header and what is not (helgi)</n>
