 <s>PHP client for the Akismet REST API</s>
 <d>This package provides an object-oriented interface to the Akismet REST API. The Akismet API is used to detect and to filter spam comments posted on weblogs.

There are several anti-spam service providers that use the Akismet API. To use the API, you will need an API key from such a provider. Example providers include Wordpress (http://wordpress.com) and TypePad (http://antispam.typepad.com).

Most services are free for personal or low-volume use, and offer licensing for commercial or high-volume applications.

This package is derived from the miPHP Akismet class written by Bret Kuhns for use in PHP 4. This package requires PHP 5.2.1.</d>
