 <s>A PHP Grammar Parser</s>
 <d>PHP_Parser is a source code analysis tool based around a real Parser
generated by phpJay.  The parser uses the same EBNF source that PHP
uses to parse itself, and it therefore as robust as PHP itself.
This version has full support for parsing out every re-usable element
in PHP 5 as of beta 1:
- classes
 - abstract classes
 - inheritance, implements
 - interfaces
 - methods
  - exception parsing directly from source
  - static variables declared
  - global and superglobal ($_GET) variables used
    and declared
 - variables
 - constants
- functions (same information as methods)
- defines
- global variables (with help of the Tokenizer Lexer)
- superglobal variables used in global code
- include statements

The output can be customized to return an array, return
objects of user-specified classes, and can also be
customized to publish each element as it is parsed, allowing
hooks into parsing to catch information.
