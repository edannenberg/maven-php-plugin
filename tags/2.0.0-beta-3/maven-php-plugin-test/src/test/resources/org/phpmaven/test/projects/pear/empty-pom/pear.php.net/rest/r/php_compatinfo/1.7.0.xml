 <n>After 1 alpha and 4 beta releases, I am pleased to announce the
release of final stable version. This new API 1.7.0 introduce many new features.
Here are a summary of all changes since API 1.6.0.

All SAPI:
=========
* news
- add 3 options:
  ignore_functions_match, ignore_extensions_match, ignore_constants_match.
  ==&gt; Request #12857
- separate constants and tokens in results
  ==&gt; Request #13138

* changes
- full support of regular expressions for &quot;ignore_dirs&quot; and &quot;ignore_files&quot; options.
- all reports display now the max version information when needed.

* bugs
- #13568 : User functions are not ignored
- #13417 : Parser ignore class-method that are named as standard php functions
- #13137 : Standard test suite failed under *nix

CLI only:
=========
* news
- Add new --output-level switch to customize (all) reports output.
  ==&gt; Request #13493
- Add new --summarize switch to limit output to first line (summary)
  when parsing directory.
- Add new --version switch to print version number of PHP_CompatInfo package.
- Add --filter-ext switch to filter file extension when parsing directory
  ==&gt; Request #13147
- Add new column C to indicate a level of conditional code used (0: none,
  1: function_exists() used, 2: extension_loaded() used, 4: defined() used)

* changes
- XML report structure change.
  Render is improve if PEAR::XML_Beautifier is available.
- pci.php file was rename to pci (without extension) to match unix command syntax
- Text report is now really limited to 80 columns in all situation
- All switchs that accept option file parameter allow now
  to put line in comment with ; character (as in php.ini)

* QA
- dependencies Console_Table, Console_GetArgs, XML_Util
  are defined as required and no more optional. CLI is a standard feature and should
  not be considered as optional.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since version 1.7.0b4 (2008-04-03)

- parseString(), parseFile() and parseArray() handle now correctly the new
  key-info &quot;cond_code&quot;.
