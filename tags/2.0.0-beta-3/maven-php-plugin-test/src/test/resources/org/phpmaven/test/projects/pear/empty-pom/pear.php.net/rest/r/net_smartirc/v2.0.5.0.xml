 <n>Initial release as PEAR package
this project is former known as phpSmartIRCclass
(beta because of first release in PEAR, the project itself is stable)

ChangeLog:
  fixes:
  - copyright year
  - fixed critical bug in the main _rawreceive() for() loop, messages were lost.
  
  changes:
  - changed documentation tags in front of all methods to the phpDocumentator compatible format.
  - improved connect() errorhandling.
  - changed login() parameters to $nick, $realname, $usermode = 0, $username = null, $password = null.
  - changed join() parameters to $channelarray, $key = null.
  - changed kick() parameters to $channel, $nicknamearray, $reason = null.
  - changed listenFor() parameters to $messagetype
    return value is now the result, instead the of a reference to the result parameter.
  - sendbuffer has now 3 queues: high, medium and low
    high sends 2 messages, then 1 of medium
    low is only send if high _and_ medium is empty.
  - select() call for sockets is strongly optimized
  
  new:
  - phpDocumentator package tags.
  - include() for messagehandler.php (needed for the new API).
  - setChannelSynching() method, for enabling the channel synching.
  - setCtcpVersion() method, for changing the ctcp version reply string.
  - setReceiveTimeout() method, for changing the receive timeout.
  - setTransmitTimeout() method, for changing the transmit timeout.
  - setAutoReconnect() method, for enabling the autoreconnect feature.
  - channel variable, a reference to _channels because $object-&gt;channel(&quot;#chan&quot;)-&gt;topic is not possible in PHP4 (ZE1).
  - reconnect() method, it will reconnect and also join all channels.
  - channel() method, getting a reference to the channel, only if channelsynching is on.
  - added ident, host, messageex and rawmessageex variables to the Net_SmartIRC_data class.
  - class Net_SmartIRC_user, stores info about one user, only used if channelsynching is on.
  - class Net_SmartIRC_channel, stores info about one channel, only used if channelsynching is on.</n>
