 <s>Classes that define Quaternions and their operations</s>
 <d>Classes that represent and manipulate quaternions. Contain definitions
for basic arithmetic functions in a static class.
Quaternions are an extension of the idea of complex numbers, and
a quaternion is defined as: 
    q = a + b*i + c*j + d*k
In 1844 Hamilton described a system in which numbers were composed of
a real part and 3 imaginary and independent parts (i,j,k), such that:
    i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = -1       and
    ij = k, jk = i, ki = j     and
    ji = -k, kj = -i, ik = -j
The above are known as &quot;Hamilton's rules&quot;</d>
