 <s>The add-on to HTML_QuickForm package that allows building of multipage forms</s>
 <d>The package is essentially an implementation of a PageController pattern.
Architecture:
* Controller class that examines HTTP requests and manages form values persistence across requests.
* Page class (subclass of QuickForm) representing a single page of the form.
* Business logic is contained in subclasses of Action class.
Cool features:
* Includes several default Actions that allow easy building of multipage forms.
* Includes usage examples for common usage cases (single-page form, wizard, tabbed form).

 <n>This is a recommended upgrade for users running HTML_QuickForm 3.2.5

* Fixed bug #3443: honour session.use_only_cookies setting by not passing
  session ID in URL when it is on.
* Fixed bug #5615: some elements' values not displayed properly after
  browsing back to a form page (see also bug #5625)
* Fixed bug #5641: unwanted target=&quot;_self&quot; form attribute
* Fixed bug #5743: wrong element name in example file statemachine.php

* Implemented request #4973: internal values may be filtered from the
  array returned by HTML_QuickForm_Page::exportValues()
* Redone tabbed.php example to use a common base class instead of
  braindead copy-paste technique (see also request #5234)</n>
