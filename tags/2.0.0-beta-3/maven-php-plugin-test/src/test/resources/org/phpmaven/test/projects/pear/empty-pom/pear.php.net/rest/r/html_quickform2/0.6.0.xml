 <s>PHP5 rewrite of HTML_QuickForm package</s>
 <d>PHP5 rewrite of HTML_QuickForm and HTML_QuickForm_Controller packages.
 
 This package provides methods to create, validate and render HTML forms.
 
 Features:
   * Supports all form elements defined by HTML standard, provides several
     custom elements
   * Server-side and client-side validation, several common rules provided
   * Multipage forms (tabbed forms and wizards)
   * Pluggable elements, rules, renderers and renderer plugins

 Major advantages over PHP4 version:
   * DOM-like API for building the form structure, new streamlined API for 
     elements' values handling
   * Default rendering without tables (inspired by
     HTML_QuickForm_Renderer_Tableless)
   * Renderer plugins for elements with complex rendering needs
   * Ability to chain validation rules with 'and' and 'or'</d>

 <n>Milestone 6: &quot;live&quot; validation, localization changes, moving to beta

Major additions and changes
  * It is now possible to run client-side validation rules on changing the
    fields value / leaving the field (onchange / onblur) as well as on form
    submit (see request #5308)
  * Client-side validation errors are now displayed near the elements by
    default instead of in javascript alert() dialog. This is mostly similar 
    to behaviour of old HTML_QuickForm_DHTMLRulesTableless package.
  * Localization messages (month and weekday names for Date, upload errors for
    InputFile) are now returned by special &quot;message provider&quot; object
    or callback (request #18341). A message provider for Date element using
    current locale data is available (request #5558)
  * Added a new optional renderer that uses PHP callbacks to render form elements

Other features and changes
  * Static elements can now wrap their content in a given tag having element's
    attributes, e.g. &lt;div&gt; or &lt;img&gt; (see request #8626)
  * It is now possible to set maximum and minimum hour in Date element's hours
    select (request #4061, works for 24-hour format) and maximum and minimum
    month in its months select (request #5957)
  * File upload elements can no longer be added to method=&quot;get&quot; forms,
    form's enctype attribute is automatically set (request #16807)
  * Added a separate HTML_QuickForm2::isSubmitted() method, can be used to 
    check whether the form was sumbitted instead of checking an array of its
    data sources for submit one
  * Added HTML_QuickForm2_Renderer::methodExists() method, this can be used
    to check whether a custom renderer has a necessary method / plugin and
    fall back to the Default renderer if it doesn't
  * Added default 'value' attribute for radiobuttons
  * Array renderer always returns group separator as an array of length
    count($group) - 1, making it easier to use in templates
  * Added CLIENT_SERVER and ONBLUR_CLIENT_SERVER constants to
    HTML_QuickForm2_Rule, these make calls to addRule() less verbose
  * Minified versions of javascript libraries are now provided

Bug fixes
  * Unit tests can now run under PHPUnit 3.5
  * Required rule will throw an Exception if not given an error message (bug #18133)
  * Default maxYear in Date element is now current year rather than 2010 (bug #18171)
  * Group::removeChild() failed if group's name contained brackets (bug #18182)
  * Values for elements named like 'foo[]' are now properly handled by getValue()

Backwards compatibility issues
  * Javascript libraries are now installed into js/ and js/min/ subdirectories
    of base data directory
  * 'errorMessages' parameter for HTML_QuickForm2_Element_InputFile is
    deprecated and will be removed in the next release. Use message providers</n>
