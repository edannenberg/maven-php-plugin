 <s>PEAR Base System</s>
 <d>The PEAR package contains:
 * the PEAR base class
 * the PEAR_Error error handling mechanism
 * the PEAR installer, for creating, distributing
   and installing packages
</d>
 <da>2002-05-26 12:55:00</da>
 <n>Lots of stuff this time.  0.9 was not actually self-hosting, even
though it claimed to be.  This version finally is self-hosting
(really!), meaning you can upgrade the installer with the command
&quot;pear upgrade PEAR&quot;.

* new config paramers: http_proxy and umask
* HTTP proxy support when downloading packages
* generalized command handling code
* and fixed the bug that would not let commands have the
  same options as &quot;pear&quot; itself
* added long options to every command
* added command shortcuts (&quot;pear help shortcuts&quot;)
* added stub for Gtk installer
* some phpdoc fixes
* added class dependency detector (using ext/tokenizer)
* dependency handling fixes
* added OS_Guess class for detecting OS
* install files with the &quot;platform&quot; attribute set
  only on matching operating systems
* PEAR_Remote now falls back to the XML_RPC package
  if xmlrpc-epi is not available
* renamed command: package-list -&gt; list
* new command: package-dependencies
* lots of minor fixes</n>
