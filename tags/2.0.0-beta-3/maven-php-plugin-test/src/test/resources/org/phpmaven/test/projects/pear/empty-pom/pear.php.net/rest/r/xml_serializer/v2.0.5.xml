 <s>Package to build XML documents from data structures and unserialize the XML documents to PHP structures.</s>
 <d>XML_Serializer serializes complex data structures like arrays or object as XML documents.
This class helps you generating any XML document you require without the need for DOM.
Furthermore this package can be used as a replacement to serialize() und unserialize() as it comes with a matching XML_Unserializer that is able to create PHP data strcutures (like arrays and objects) from XML documents, if type hints are available.
If you use the XML_Unserialzer on standard XML files, it will try to guess how it has to be unserialized. In most cases it does exactly what you expect it to do. Try reading a RSS file with XML_Unserializer and you have the  whole RSS file in a structured array, similar to XML_RSS.

 <n>Unserializer is now able to unserialize XML files w/o type hints by automatically transforming multiple occurences of the same tag to an indexed array
This is now similar to ext/simpleXML in PHP5 that means it can be used to parse any XML file, try it with your favorite RSS feed</n>
