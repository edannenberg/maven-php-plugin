 <d>Abstracts parsing and rendering rules for Wiki markup in structured plain text.
</d>
 <da>2004-05-22 16:25:55</da>
 <n>* code rule no longer trims the contents, this leaves leading and trailing preformatted white space in place
* in newline and paragraph skipped elements, added code and phpcode
* entities rule now converts all entities (instead of just specialchars) except the token delimiter
* extra newline after table, deflist, and list rules to help with paragraph parsing
* list rule now adds &quot;display: inline;&quot; to list-item style to help with MSIE display
* url rule now has 'images' rule conf key to turn image processing on and off
* started adding renderPlain() method to all rules, will render the source with all markup removed (not done yet)</n>
