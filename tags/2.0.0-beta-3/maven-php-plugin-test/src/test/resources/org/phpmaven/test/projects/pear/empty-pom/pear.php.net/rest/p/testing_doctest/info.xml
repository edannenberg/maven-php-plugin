 <s>A Unit Test framework for writing tests in your php code docstrings.</s>
 <d>Testing_DocTest allows the developer to write unit tests directly in the &amp;amp;lt;code&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;/code&amp;amp;gt; blocs of your functions, classes and class methods doc comments.

It comes with a default runner (phpdt) that will parse all your &amp;amp;lt;code&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;/code&amp;amp;gt; blocs and will run the extracted tests. 
Running tests is as simple as:

$ phpdt /path/to/your/code

There are several advantages in using Testing_DocTest:
  * it makes unit tests writing funnier, easier and quicker (there's no infrastructure to setup, you just install the package, write your code examples tests and you're done !);
  * it ensures that doc comments are up-to-date by verifying that all examples work as documented;
  * it enforces writing of tutorial documentation, liberally illustrated with input-output examples.</d>
