 <s>PHP_CodeSniffer tokenises PHP, JavaScript and CSS files and detects violations of a defined set of coding standards.</s>
 <d>PHP_CodeSniffer is a PHP5 script that tokenises and &quot;sniffs&quot; PHP, JavaScript and CSS files to detect violations of a defined coding standard. It is an essential development tool that ensures your code remains clean and consistent. It can also help prevent some common semantic errors made by developers.</d>
