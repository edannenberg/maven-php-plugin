 <s>PHP_CodeSniffer tokenises PHP, JavaScript and CSS files and detects violations of a defined set of coding standards.</s>
 <d>PHP_CodeSniffer is a PHP5 script that tokenises and &quot;sniffs&quot; PHP, JavaScript and CSS files to detect violations of a defined coding standard. It is an essential development tool that ensures your code remains clean and consistent. It can also help prevent some common semantic errors made by developers.</d>

 <n>- The core PHP_CodeSniffer_File methods now understand the concept of closures (feature request #16866)
  -- Thanks to Christian Kaps for the sample code
- Sniffs can now specify violation codes for each error and warning they add
  -- Future versions will allow you to override messages and severities using these codes
  -- Specifying a code is optional, but will be required if you wish to support overriding
- All reports have been broken into separate classes
  -- Command line usage and report output remains the same
  -- Thanks to Gabriele Santini for the patch
- Added an interactive mode that can be enabled using the -a command line argument
  -- Scans files and stops when it finds a file with errors
  -- Waits for user input to recheck the file (hopefully you fixed the errors) or skip the file
  -- Useful for very large code bases where full rechecks take a while
- The reports now show the correct number of errors and warnings found

- Squiz FileCommentSniff now ensures the open comment tag is the only content on the first line
- Squiz FunctionCommentSniff now ensures the open comment tag is the only content on the first line
- Squiz VariableCommentSniff now ensures the open comment tag is the only content on the first line
- Squiz NonExecutableCodeSniff now warns about empty return statements that are not required
- Removed ForbiddenStylesSniff from Squiz standard
  -- It is now in in the MySource standard as BrowserSpecificStylesSniff
  -- New BrowserSpecificStylesSniff ignores files with browser-specific suffixes
- MySource IncludeSystemSniff no longer throws errors when extending the Exception class
- MySource IncludeSystemSniff no longer throws errors for the abstract widget class
- MySource IncludeSystemSniff and UnusedSystemSniff now allow includes inside IF statements
