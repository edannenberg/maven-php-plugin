 <n>Fix broken release (1.9.1 and 1.9.2)

fetchAll() / whereAddIn() Release version.

This version adds two new utility methods, that can speed up usage,
fetchAll()  - does the $do-&gt;find() / while($do-&gt;fetch()) $ar[] = clone($do) loop, and more.
whereAddIn() - allows you to quickly build IN queries, with correct escaping.</n>
