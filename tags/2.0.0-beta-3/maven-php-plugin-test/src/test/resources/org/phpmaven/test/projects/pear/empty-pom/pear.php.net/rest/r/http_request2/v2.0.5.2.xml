  * Curl adapter, wraps around PHP's cURL extension,
  * Mock adapter, to use for testing packages dependent on HTTP_Request2.
Supports POST requests with data and file uploads, basic and digest 
authentication, cookies, proxies, gzip and deflate encodings, redirects,
monitoring the request progress with Observers...</d>

 <n>* magic_quotes_runtime PHP setting could be incorrectly enabled after
  performing the request (bug #16440)
* Unit tests fixes (bugs #17079, #17106, #17326)
* Observer_Log now appends to the log file rather than rewrites it (thanks to
  troelskn at gmail dot com for reporting)</n>
