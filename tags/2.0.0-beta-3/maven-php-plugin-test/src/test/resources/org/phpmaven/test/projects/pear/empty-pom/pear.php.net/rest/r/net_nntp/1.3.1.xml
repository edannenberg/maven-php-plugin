 <s>NNTP implementation</s>
 <d>PEAR's package for communication with NNTP/Usenet servers.
Net_NNTP handles the connection and protocol level commands (RFC977), including many commonly implemented non-standard commands (RFC2980).
Net_NNTP includes an unserfriendly API for intermediate user, who don't want to work directly at the command level. However, Net_NNTP does require some knowlege about the NNTP protocol (RFC 977), and general knowledge about email (RFC(2)822) and MIME (2045-2048), since any handling of both content and headers is left up to the user!
The protocol implementation does not parse the actual article data, but at the command level it splits returned data at protocol specified boundaries where appropriate.</d>

 <n>+ Changes in Net_NNTP_Client:
  - added: mail() as a replacement for experimental post() using identical parameters as PHP's mail() function, (temporarily) preserving backward compatibility with experimental method in v1.0.
  - modified and rewritten: post(), reduced to having only one parameter, (temporarily) preserving backward compatibility with experimental method in v1.0.

+ Changes in Net_NNTP_Protocol_Client:
  - added: _sendArticle()
  - modified and rewritten: cmdPost() split into cmdPost() and cmdPost2() + now sends data via _sendArticle()
  - modified and rewritten: cmdIhave() split into cmdIhave() and cmdIhave2() + now sends data via _sendArticle()</n>
