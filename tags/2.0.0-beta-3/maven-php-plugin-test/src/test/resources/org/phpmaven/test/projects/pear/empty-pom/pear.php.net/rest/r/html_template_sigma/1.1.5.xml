 <s>An implementation of Integrated Templates API with template 'compilation' added</s>
 <d>HTML_Template_Sigma implements Integrated Templates API designed by Ulf Wendel.

Features:
* Nested blocks. Nesting is controlled by the engine.
* Ability to include files from within template: &amp;lt;!-- INCLUDE --&amp;gt;
* Automatic removal of empty blocks and unknown variables (methods to manually tweak/override this are also available)
* Methods for runtime addition and replacement of blocks in templates
* Ability to insert simple function calls into templates: func_uppercase('Hello world!') and to define callback functions for these
* 'Compiled' templates: the engine has to parse a template file using regular expressions to find all the blocks and variable placeholders. This is a very &quot;expensive&quot; operation and is an overkill to do on every page request: templates seldom change on production websites. Thus this feature: an internal representation of the template structure is saved into a file and this file gets loaded instead of the source one on subsequent requests (unless the source changes)
* PHPUnit-based tests to define correct behaviour
* Usage examples for most of the features are available, look in the docs/ directory

 <n>Fixed bug #6346: typo in _buildFunctionList()
Fixed bug #6902: correctly handle drive letters and path separators on Windows
Fixed bug #6905: use 'b' modifier for fopen() to prevent problems with cached templates on Windows
Calling setCacheRoot() with an empty argument will now disable caching. It was impossible
to disable it with previous behaviour.

Added possibility to pass arrays as second arguments to setVariable() and setGlobalVariable(),
this will assign values to placeholders of the form {varName.arrayKey} in the template.
Thanks to Franz Pentenrieder &lt;franz at quox.net&gt; for idea and original implementation.</n>
