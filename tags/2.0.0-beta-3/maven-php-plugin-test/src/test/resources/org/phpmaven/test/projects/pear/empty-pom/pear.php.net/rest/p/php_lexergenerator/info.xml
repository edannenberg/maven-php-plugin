 <s>translate lexer files in lex2php format into a PHP 5 lexer</s>
 <d>Translate a lexer file with a format similar to re2c (http://re2c.org)
  into a PHP 5 lexer for use with a parser.
  
  Unlike re2c (as of re2c version 0.11), generated lexers are state-aware
  out of the box.
  
  Generated lexers are very efficient, more than twice as efficient as other
  alternatives like csLex (written in C#) because they utilize PHP's
  built-in Perl-compatible regular expressions to lex for tokens.

  Now in version 0.3.0+, with processing instruction %longestmatch, generated
  lexers will always pick the longest string to match, rather than the first.
  Generated lexers are slightly slower, but match behavior of legacy lexers like
  flex, lex, re2c.</d>
