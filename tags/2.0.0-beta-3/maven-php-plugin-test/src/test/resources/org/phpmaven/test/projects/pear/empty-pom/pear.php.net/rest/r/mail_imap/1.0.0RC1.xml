 <s>Provides a c-client backend for webmail.</s>
 <d>Mail_IMAP provides a simplified backend for working with the c-client (IMAP) extension. It serves as an OO wrapper for commonly used c-client functions. It provides structure and header parsing as well as body retrieval.
Mail_IMAP provides a simple inbox example that demonstrates its ability to parse and view simple and multipart email messages.
Mail_IMAP also provides a connection wizard to determine the correct protocol and port settings for a remote mail server, all you need to provide is a server, a username and a password.
Mail_IMAP may be used as a webmail backend or as a component in a mailing list manager.
This package requires the c-client extension.  To download the latest version of the c-client extension goto: http://www.php.net/imap.

 <n>Added $mailboxInfo member variable, which stores various information about
the current mailbox.  As of its implementation it only stores user and folder
information gathered from the URI abstraction, if one is being used.  This
variable could be expanded in the future to contain more mailbox specific
information.
Cleaned up and expanded example files, IMAP.inbox.php and IMAP.message.php.
Example files now check for &quot;read&quot; flags in webmail demonstration.
Minor edits to the documentation.
Fixed missing `empty` in getQuota method.
MAIL_IMAP_CLEAR_FLAGS option added for setFlags() method, new constant toggles
flag operation to imap_clearflag_full instead of imap_setflag_full.</n>
