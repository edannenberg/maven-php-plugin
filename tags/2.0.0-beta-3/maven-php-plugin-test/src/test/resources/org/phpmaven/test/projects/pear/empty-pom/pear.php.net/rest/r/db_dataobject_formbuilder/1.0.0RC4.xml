 <s>Class to automatically build HTML_QuickForm objects from a DB_DataObject-derived class</s>
 <d>DB_DataObject_FormBuilder will aid you in rapid application development using the packages DB_DataObject and HTML_QuickForm. For having a quick but working prototype of your application, simply model the database, run DataObject's createTable script over it and write a script that passes one of the resulting objects to the FormBuilder class. The FormBuilder will automatically generate a simple but working HTML_QuickForm object that you can use to test your application. It also provides a processing method that will automatically detect if an insert() or update() command has to be executed after the form has been submitted. If you have set up DataObject's links.ini file correctly, it will also automatically detect if a table field is a foreign key and will populate a selectbox with the linked table's entries. There are many optional parameters that you can place in your DataObjects.ini or in the properties of your derived classes, that you can use to fine-tune the form-generation, gradually turning the prototypes into fully-featured forms, and you can take control at any stage of the process.</d>

 <n>(Fixed since 1.0.0RC3)
* Fixed undefined index notice in SubForm.php and other possible breakage

(Changelog for 1.0.0RC3)
* Fixed &quot;only variables should be assigned by reference&quot; notices (bug #5733)
* Fixed a bug where boolean fields in the booleanFields option were overridden when not set as editable
* Fixed a bug where cross/reverse/tripleLinks were processed when not set editable or rendered
* Fixed notice about undefined variable $ordered (bug #6894)

* Added linkNewNalue support for reverseLinks (Thanks to Brett Beiber for this patch)
** Adds _createSubForm in the QuickForm renderer
** Multiple SubForms are allowed for each reverseLink</n>
