 <s>Render a data table with automatic pagination and sorting</s>
 <d>This package provides a toolkit to generate data tables in HTML, CSV,
 Excel, XML, Smarty, and other formats.  
 It retrieves data from a variety of data sources, including SQL, CSV,
 XML, PDO, DB_DataObject, DB_Table, and others.
 It can transparently page and sort the data, through optimized database
 queries, by parsing/generating GET, POST requests and REST-like urls.
 It is designed with modularity and extensibility in mind, using drivers
 for all rendering and datasource formats.</d>
