interface for handling CSV files.

 <da>2005-01-12 03:54:12</da>
 <n>* added File_Util containing all methods not handling file I/O (mike)
* deprecated methods are now available in File_Util (still in File for BC) (mike)
* fixed bug #2827 (File_CSV::discoverFormat() is unable to discover format in 
  one column CSV file), allows 1 field per line in discoverFormat as well as 
  the config overall, with no separator (which is the standard), removed 
  one error check to fix this issue as well as moving error checking around 
  in _conf, might give some people issues (can't see how tho), also added a 
  new param to discoverFormat so one can inject a check for $ as a separator 
  or something like that (dufuz)</n>
