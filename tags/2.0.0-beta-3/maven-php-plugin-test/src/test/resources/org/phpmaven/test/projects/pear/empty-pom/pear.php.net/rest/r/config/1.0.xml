 <s>The Config package provides methods for editing configuration datasources</s>
 <d>The Config package provides methods for editing configuration datasources.
It does so in an object oriented manner, defining each and every items found in the config datasource as a Config_Container of various types (comments, sections, directives, blanks, ...).
Items can then be edited, added, removed, inserted.
This package is not intended for reading configuration data only, but for editing them. If you only want to read your configuration data, use functions like parse_ini_file() and the like instead, they are much faster.

 <n>Complete rewrite : API has changed.
The class now uses a tree structure of container objects.
As a consequence, backward compatibility is not provided !!!
Look at the Apache.php and IniCommented.php scripts in 'docs' for usage examples.
Some containers are still missing : XML and DB.</n>
