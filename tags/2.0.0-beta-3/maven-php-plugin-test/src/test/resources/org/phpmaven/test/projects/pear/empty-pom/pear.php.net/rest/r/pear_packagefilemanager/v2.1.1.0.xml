 <s>PEAR_PackageFileManager takes an existing package.xml file and updates it with a new filelist and changelog</s>
 <d>This package revolutionizes the maintenance of PEAR packages.  With a few parameters,
the entire package.xml is automatically updated with a listing of all files in a package.
Features include
 - reads in an existing package.xml file, and only changes the release/changelog
 - a plugin system for retrieving files in a directory.  Currently two plugins
   exist, one for standard recursive directory content listing, and one that
   reads the CVS/Entries files and generates a file listing based on the contents
   of a checked out CVS repository
 - incredibly flexible options for assigning install roles to files/directories
 - ability to ignore any file based on a * ? wildcard-enabled string(s)
 - ability to include only files that match a * ? wildcard-enabled string(s)
 - ability to manage dependencies
 - can output the package.xml in any directory, and read in the package.xml
   file from any directory.
 - can specify a different name for the package.xml file
 
As of version 1.1.0, PEAR_PackageFileManager is partially unit tested.
Version 1.1.1 will contain the rest of the unit tests.

 <n>unit-tested with 1 new feature: include

- fixed #8: notices if a package has no dependencies
- fixed #261: package.xml files shouldn't be included in the package file list
- fixed #155: warning emitted if CVS/ is packaged
- fixed #260: .cvsignore files should be excluded from package file lists
- new feature, &quot;include&quot; option.  This works just like &quot;ignore&quot; except it
  excludes all files that do not match the names passed in.  &quot;ignore&quot; includes
  only files that do not match the names passed in.  Suggested by Stan Lemon</n>
