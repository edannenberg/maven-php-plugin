 <s>An object oriented interface to, and model of, a database. Integrates with HTML_QuickForm.</s>
 <d>The DB_Table package provides an object oriented interface to a database. 

Each instance of the core DB_Table class contains the schema for a table, defined using abstract data types. The class provides a portable api for insert, update, delete, and select SQL commands, and can validate data types upon insertion and updating. It provides methods to automatically create or verify a database table. DB_Table also provides methods (using PEAR HTML_QuickForm) to generate input forms that match the column definitions. 

Each instance of the DB_Table_Database class contains a model of relationships between tables in a database, in which each table is represented by an instance of DB_Table. DB_Table_Database provides a method for automatic construction of join conditions for inner joins involving any number of tables, optional php validation of foreign key validity, and optional php emulation of actions triggered on delete or update of referenced rows, such as cascading deletes.

The DB_Table_Generator class auto-generates the php code necessary to create an interface to an existing database.</d>

- Request #12136: support for 'qf_type' == 'link' is now available, providing
  access to the &quot;link&quot; element of HTML_QuickForm; the link href needs to be
  specified in the 'qf_href' key, the link text needs to be specified in the
  'qf_setvalue' key
  (thanks to Diederick Huijbers)
- Bug #12190: missing error return in DB_Table_Manager::create() 
  (thanks to Carsten Wiedmann for the patch)
- Bug #12208: wrong verification of clob fields with mysql(i) backend
  (thanks to Carsten Wiedmann)
- Bug #12247: 'require' attribute is name 'required' in Generator
  (thanks to Gregor Gramlich)
- Bug #12497: Generator works only with DB, but not with MDB2
  (thanks to Carsten Wiedmann for the patch)
- Request #12510: various optimizations (mostly coding standards) and
  corrections (missing error return call, change MDB2's portability mode only
  temporarily) 
  (thanks to Carsten Wiedmann for the patch)
- Request #13267: constructor's $table parameter is now optional; this change
  allows to set a fixed table name via the $table property in the DB_Table
  subclass</n>
