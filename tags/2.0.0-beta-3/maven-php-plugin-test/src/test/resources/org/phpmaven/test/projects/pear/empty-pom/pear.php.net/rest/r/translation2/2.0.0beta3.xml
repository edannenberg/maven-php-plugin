 <s>Class for multilingual applications management.</s>
 <d>This class provides an easy way to retrieve all the strings for a multilingual
site from a data source (i.e. db).
The following containers are provided, more will follow:
- PEAR::DB
- PEAR::MDB
- PEAR::MDB2
- gettext
- XML
- PEAR::DB_DataObject (experimental)
It is designed to reduce the number of queries to the db, caching the results when possible.
An Admin class is provided to easily manage translations (add/remove a language, add/remove a string).
Currently, the following decorators are provided:
- CacheLiteFunction (for file-based caching)
- CacheMemory (for memory-based caching)
- DefaultText (to replace empty strings with their keys)
- Iconv (to switch from/to different encodings)
- Lang (resort to fallback languages for empty strings)
- SpecialChars (replace html entities with their hex codes)
- UTF-8 (to convert UTF-8 strings to ISO-8859-1)
</d>

 <n>- Welcome to the new developers, Ian Eure and Michael Wallner
- The last release contained an old gettext driver (bug #2503) (ieure)
- Many portability fixes applied to the database containers (thanks to Ian Eure and
  Xavier Lembo for their suggestions and patches)
- Minor changes to the table definitions for better portability (lowercase field names,
  VARCHAR instead of CHAR, bigger field size)
- setLang() now returns an error if called with an unknown $langID (bug #2498).
- Added $cleaningFrequency option to the CacheLiteFunction to implement
  statistic cache cleaning
- Added Translation2_Admin::cleanCache() method to clean the cache on demand.
  It is automatically triggered after a change if $options['autoCleanCache'] is TRUE.
- Big cleanup of the DB and Admin_DB containers. See CVS changelog for details.
  (ieure)
- Added update() method to Translation2_Admin. This is a BC break; you used to be able
  to update strings with add(). This is no longer possible, use update(). (ieure)
- Re-added a check in add() to see if an update() is needed instead of an insert
- String ID columns are created as type TEXT to support gettext-style string IDs.
  (ieure)
- Reflect the changes made to the DB container into the MDB and MDB2 containers too,
  plus other minor fixes/optimizations.
- strings_default_table may use %s to represent the language name. You may now have one
  table per language without having to explicitly specify them all. (ieure)
- DefaultText decorator has new getStringID() method, which will return the string which
  was requested if no stringID exists. This mirrors the gettext() semantics. (ieure)
- Added Admin_Decorator class, which allows you to create Decorators for
  Translation2_Admin. (ieure)
- New 'Autoadd' Admin Decorator, which automatically adds requested strings. (ieure)
- Removed translate(), added getStringID(). You can mimic the old behaviour in
  two steps:
  $stringID = $tr-&gt;getStringID('mystring', 'mypage');
  $translatedString = $tr-&gt;get($stringID, 'mypage', $otherLangID);
- Major cleanup of the gettext container and added some examples (mike)
- removeLang() was missing. Fixed.
- The gettext container no longer require the gettext extension (thanks to Sergey Korotkov);
  it is used when loaded, though, since it's faster.
- Both .mo and .po files are valid data sources for the gettext container (Sergey Korotkov)
- New Iconv decorator based on the one written by Sergey Korotkov
- Added a new &quot;encoding&quot; column to the langsAvail table
- New xml container by Olivier Guilyardi</n>
