 <s>An Gtk Database schema designer</s>
 <d>A graphical database schema designer, based loosely around the MDB schema,
it features
  - table boxes which are dragged around a window to layout your database
  - add/delete tables
  - add delete columns
  - support for NotNull, Indexes, Sequences , Unique Indexes and  defaults
  - works totally in non-connected mode (eg. no database or setting up required)
  
  - stores in MDB like xml file.
  - saves to any supported database SQL create tables files.
  - screenshots at http://devel.akbkhome.com/screenshots/Gtk_MDB/
  
  
Future enhancements: 
  - real MDB schema exports 
  - relationships = with lines etc.
Note: the primary aim is to generate SQL files, (so that I can get my work done)
however it is eventually planned to support MDB schema's fully.. - just a matter of time..

To use - just pear install and run gtkmdbdesigner
