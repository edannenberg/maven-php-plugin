 <s>Berkely-style database abstraction class</s>
 <d>DBA is a wrapper for the php DBA functions. It includes a file-based emulator
and provides a uniform, object-based interface for the gdbm and db3 database systems.

 <n>There is little new about DBA itself. However, this release does not include a
lot of the pieces that were included with the earlier developer releases, such
as the table manager and SQL parser. These have been split into separate
packages so that the core DBA class can go ahead with a stable release.

There are three changes to note:

 * The 'simple' driver has been renamed to 'file'. This is a better description,
   and shorter too.

 * Support for opening a database persistently using the Builtin driver.
   See the docs for open() on that driver. Persistence is not supported with the
   'file' driver.

 * Lastly, the installation directory structure is changed. Rather than
   installing into a subdirectory of the DB packages (DB/DBA), DBA now installs
   into the PEAR root directory into its own subdirectory (DBA.php, DBA).
   Rather than use 'require &quot;DB/DBA/DBA.php&quot;;' use 'require &quot;DBA.php&quot;;'
   Much simpler!</n>
