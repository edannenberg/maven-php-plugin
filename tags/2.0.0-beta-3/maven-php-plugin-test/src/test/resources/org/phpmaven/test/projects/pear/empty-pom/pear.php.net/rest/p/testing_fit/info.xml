 <s>FIT: Framework for Integrated Test</s>
 <d>Great software requires collaboration and communication.
Fit is a tool for enhancing collaboration in software development.
It's an invaluable way to collaborate on complicated problems--and
get them right--early in development.
Fit allows customers, testers, and programmers to learn what their
software should do and what it does do. It automatically compares
customers' expectations to actual results.</d>
