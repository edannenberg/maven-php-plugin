 <s>Construct and validate a logical chess game, does not display</s>
 <d>The logic of handling a chessboard and parsing standard
FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) for describing a position as well as SAN
(Standard Algebraic Notation) for describing individual moves is handled.  This
class can be used as a backend driver for playing chess, or for validating
and/or creating PGN files using the File_ChessPGN package (when it is completed).</d>
