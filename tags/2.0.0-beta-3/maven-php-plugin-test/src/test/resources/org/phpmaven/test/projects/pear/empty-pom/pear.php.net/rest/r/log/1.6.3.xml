 <s>Logging utilities</s>
 <d>The Log framework provides an abstracted logging system.  It supports logging to console, file, syslog, SQL, mail, and mcal targets.  It also provides a subject - observer mechanism.
</d>
 <da>2003-04-08 06:22:00</da>
 <n>A unique identifier is now stored inside each Log instance.  Both the composite and subject-observer mechanisms use this identifier to index their object lists.

The internals of the Log_observer system have been rewritten for general cleanliness.  The external interface remains unchanged.

The Log class now offers public setIdent() and getIdent() members for setting and getting the Log instance's identification string during the object's lifetime.</n>
