 <s>PHP-GTK pseudo-widgets that mimic GtkData based objects and allow the look and feel to be controlled by the programmer.</s>
 <d>While it is possible to control some style elements of a GtkScrollBar,
other elements cannot be controlled so easily. Items such as the images
at the begining and end (usually arrows) and the scroll bar that is 
dragged to scroll the element cannot be changed. This leads to 
applications that either must conform to the windowing systems look
and feel or appear incomplete. The goal of this family of PHP-GTK 
classes is to provide all the same functionality as a normal scroll
bar but allow the user to have better control over the look and feel.</d>
