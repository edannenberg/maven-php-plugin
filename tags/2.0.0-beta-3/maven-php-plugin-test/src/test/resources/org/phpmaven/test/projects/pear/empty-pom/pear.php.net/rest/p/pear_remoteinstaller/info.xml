 <s>PEAR Remote installation plugin through FTP, SFTP, and FTPS</s>
 <d>Originally part of the 1.4.0 new features,
remote installation through FTP, FTPS and SFTP is now its own package.
This package adds the commands &amp;quot;remote-install&amp;quot; &amp;quot;remote-upgrade&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;remote-uninstall&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;remote-upgrade-all&amp;quot; to the PEAR core.

To take advantage, you must have a config file on the remote
ftp server and full access to the server to create and remove
files.  The config-create command can be used to get started,
and the remote_config configuration variable is set to the
full URL as in &amp;quot;ftp://ftp.example.com/path/to/pear.ini&amp;quot; or
&amp;quot;ftps://user:pass@ftp.example.com/path/to/pear.ini&amp;quot; or
&amp;quot;ssh2.sftp://user:pass@ftp.example.com/path/to/pear.ini&amp;quot;

After this is done, install/upgrade as normal using the
remote* commands as if they were local.</d>
