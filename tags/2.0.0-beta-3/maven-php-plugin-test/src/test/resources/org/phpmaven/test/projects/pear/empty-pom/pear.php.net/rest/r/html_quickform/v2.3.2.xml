 <n>* Major changes in this release
Refactored form validation using Strategy/Factory/Singleton patterns. Rules are now
processed by subclasses of HTML_QuickForm_Rule class, HTML_QuickForm_RuleRegistry manages
registering the rules and instantiating the rule classes. Backwards compatibility was
completely preserved. (Bertrand Mansion)
- Added ability to set a rule on several elements. Added 'compare' rule that compares the 
  values of two form elements  to take advantage of this. (Alexey Borzov)
- New 'callback' rule and an improved 'email' rule.
- Function-based rules can now be used without registering.
- Added 2 new examples for built-in and custom rules. (Alexey Borzov)
- Javascript validation opportunities were enhanced, validation of groups, radios, checkboxes, 
  selects now works correctly (see also PEAR bug #184) (Alexey Borzov, Hodicska Gergely)

* Other additions and changes
- Added 'autocomplete' element. (Matteo Di Giovinazzo)
- Added possibility to check whether form was actually submitted (see also bug #185). (Alexey Borzov)
- QuickForm now correctly handles 'file' elements with [] in name, 'file' elements inside groups. (Alexey Borzov)
- 'date' element will display year select in reverse order if 'minYear' &gt; 'maxYear'. (Alexey Borzov)
- Added possibility to set increment value for some 'date' element selects. (Alexey Borzov)
- Added 'y' format to 'date' element. (Bertrand Mansion)

* Migration to 3.2
- Features that were marked deprecated in previous releases are REMOVED
- 'emailorblank' rule was REMOVED, use 'email' rule (see also PEAR bug #34)

- Fixed PEAR bug #140 (empty label tags for checkboxes and radios)
- Fixed PEAR bug #175 (error in 'date' element's German translation)
