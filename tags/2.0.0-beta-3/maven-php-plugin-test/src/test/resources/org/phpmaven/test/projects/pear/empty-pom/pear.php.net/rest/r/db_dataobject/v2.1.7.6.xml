 <s>An SQL Builder, Object Interface to Database Tables</s>
 <d>DataObject performs 2 tasks:
  1. Builds SQL statements based on the objects vars and the builder methods.
  2. acts as a datastore for a table row.
  The core class is designed to be extended for each of your tables so that you put the
  data logic inside the data classes.
  included is a Generator to make your configuration files and your base classes.

 <n>Nothing like a big release to create bugs..

Note: the last release also included method creation for setters and getters, 
  which got missed out from the changelog.
Bug Fixes:
  #3708 - Generator did not clear last files contents when generating new files.
  #3706 - Joins broke on everything except mysql (database prefix now only added to mysql)</n>
