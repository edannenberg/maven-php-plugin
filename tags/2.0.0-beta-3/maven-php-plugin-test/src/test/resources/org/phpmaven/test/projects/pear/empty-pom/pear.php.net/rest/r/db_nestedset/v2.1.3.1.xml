 <s>API to build and query nested sets</s>
 <d>DB_NestedSet let's you create trees with infinite depth
inside a relational database.
The package provides a way to
o create/update/delete nodes
o query nodes, trees and subtrees
o copy (clone) nodes, trees and subtrees
o move nodes, trees and subtrees
o call event handlers on specific events like
  on node deletion
o output the tree with
  - PEAR::HTML_TreeMenu
  - TigraMenu (http://www.softcomplex.com/products/tigra_menu/)
o It also features caching of SQL queries using PEAR::Cache

 <n>- Extended Unit Tests
- Added the CoolMenu output driver by Andy Crain
- Added Andy Crain's patch which fixes 
  + the can't move a rootnode below another rootnode bug
  + the 'Parent id not updated on move' bug 
  + a bug which led to wrong l/r values on tree operations
- Replaces non ANSI (mysql specific) queries.
  PLEASE test with other RDBMS than mySQL - this should work now
* Coding style fixes
* Took out a few of the abstract methods and _getmicrotime() to try and cut down on the size of the class.
* Optimized the query for createRootNode() slightly
* Fixed createRootNode() to work when only required parameters are passed, so that now 
  $db-&gt;createRootNode($node) will successfully create a root node at the end of the tree instead of erroring out.
- Fixed [Bug #138]: moveTree doesn't return anything
  (Thanks to [thomas at bytefreak dot de] for the report)
- Applied Lukas Smith's MDB patch - MDB support is back again!
- Adopted unit tests for MDB
- Changed the name of the property _flparams back to flparams as some applications may rely on this.</n>
