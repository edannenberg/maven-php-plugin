 <s>The PEAR Numbers_Words package provides methods for spelling numerals in words.</s>
 <d>With Numbers_Words class you can convert numbers
written in arabic digits to words in several languages.
You can convert an integer between -infinity and infinity.
If your system does not support such long numbers you can
call Numbers_Words::toWords() with just a string.

you can convert a number (decimal and fraction part) to words with currency name.
