 <s>HTTP authentication</s>
 <d>The PEAR::Auth_HTTP class provides methods for creating an HTTP
authentication system using PHP, that is similar to Apache's
realm-based .htaccess authentication.

 <n>- Added sessionSharing option to use unique session id.
  Currently, this option is set to true by default to maintain
  backward compatibility.
- Added setOption and getOption to set/get option value.
- Starting with this release, HTTP Digest Authentication (RFC2617) is
  experimentally supported. The code for HTTP Digest Authentication is 
  originally developed by Tom Pike.</n>
