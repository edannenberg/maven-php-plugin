 <s>Creates XML data from SQL queries</s>
 <d>XML_Query2XML allows you to transform the records retrieved
with one or more SQL SELECT queries into XML data. Very simple to
highly complex transformations are supported. Is was written with
performance in mind and can handle large amounts of data. No XSLT needed!
Major features:
1. XML_Query2XML works with the classes provided by PHP5's DOM XML extension
2. minimum effort necessary to get the simple jobs done
3. highly configurable for more complex tasks
4. ISO/IEC 9075-14:2005 support: mapping of SQL identifiers to XML names
5. works with any database that is supported by PEAR DB or PEAR MDB2
6. debugging and logging features
7. provides profiling features
8. in-depth documentation: tutorials and API documentation
9. Eight case studies: from very simple to highly complex scenarios
10. 168 unit tests for PHPUnit2

 <n>This release includes all changes recommeded during the PEPr voting process.
Major changes:
- asterisk shortcut that expands to all columns in the result set;
  the tutorial was updated to document this feature and a new
  case study (case 07) was added to provide a good example
- implementation of ISO/IEC 9075-14:2005 for mapping SQL identifiers to
  XML names; the tutorial was updates to document this feature and
  a new case study (case 08) was added to provide lots of examples
- new complex attribute specifications (from my own wish list)

Minor changes:
- simplification of the inner workings of the methods _hasDOMChild()
  and _getDOMChild()
- using foreach($array as $key =&gt; $value) instead of
  while(list($key, $value) = each($array))
- now comes with 168 unit tests</n>
