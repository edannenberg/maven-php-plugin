 <s>Berkely-style database abstraction class</s>
 <d>DBA is a wrapper for the php DBA functions. It includes a file-based emulator and provides a uniform, object-based interface for the Berkeley-style database systems.

 <n>Several nice changes for this release:
 * The DBA::exists() function has been renamed to DBA::db_exists(). This is to not be confused with the driver method exists().

 * Added db2 support. Apparently, it just didn't work on my OS due to outdated db2 libraries (Slackware-current). Be sure to compile PHP with db2 2.7.7.

 * Added db_drop() and drop() methods to the drivers. db_drop() is static and takes a database name as an argument; drop() deletes the currently open or last open database.

Many of the functions that were included with the earlier developer releases, such as the table manager and SQL parser, have been split into separate packages to be released soon.</n>
