 <n>* Added Keep-Alive support (request #4806), thanks to Justin Patrin for the
  initial patch. Please note that &quot;Connection: close&quot; header is still added
  by default, you need to explicitly add &quot;Connection: Keep-Alive&quot; header or
  remove &quot;Connection&quot; header if using HTTP 1.1
* A new disconnect() method was added which forces disconnection from the 
  server if Keep-Alive is used. Also two new events are sent to the Listeners:
  &quot;connect&quot; and &quot;disconnect&quot;
* Added getUrl() method (request #6589)
* Added method to properly parse header of gzip-encoded data (see RFC 1952).
  This takes care of situations when the server adds some additional data
  to the header (bug #8245) or sends data that is not gzip-encoded when
  &quot;Content-Encoding: gzip&quot; header is present (bug #8213)
* &quot;Proxy-Authorization&quot; header is now properly set by constructor
  (bug #5913)
* Fixed doc comments mentioning addBody() method instead of proper setBody()
  (bug #5969)
* Fixed erroneous removal of &quot;Content-Type&quot; header from request
  (bug #7922)
* Bogus HTTP headers are now ignored (bug #8214)
* Path is set to &quot;/&quot; if an URL without path (http://www.example.com)
  is given (bug #8662)
* Moved to package.xml version 2.0</n>
