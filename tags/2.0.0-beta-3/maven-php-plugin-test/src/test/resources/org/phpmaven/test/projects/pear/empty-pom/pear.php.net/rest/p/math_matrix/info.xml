 <s>Class to represent matrices and matrix operations</s>
 <d>Matrices are represented as 2 dimensional arrays of numbers. 
This class defines methods for matrix objects, as well as static methods 
to read, write and manipulate matrices, including methods to solve systems 
of linear equations (with and without iterative error correction).
Requires the Math_Vector package.
For running the unit tests you will need PHPUnit version 0.6.2 or older.</d>
