 <s>Show Information about your PEAR install and its packages</s>
 <d>This package generates a comprehensive information page for your current PEAR install.
* The format for the page is similar to that for phpinfo() except using PEAR colors.
* Has complete PEAR Credits (based on the packages you have installed).
* Will show if there is a newer version than the one presently installed (and what its state is)
* Each package has an anchor in the form pkg_PackageName - where PackageName is a case-sensitive PEAR package name
