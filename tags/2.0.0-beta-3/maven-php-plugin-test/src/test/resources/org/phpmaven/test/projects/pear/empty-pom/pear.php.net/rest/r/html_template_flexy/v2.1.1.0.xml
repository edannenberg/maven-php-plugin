 <s>An extremely powerful Tokenizer driven Template engine</s>
 <d>HTML_Template_Flexy started it's life as a simplification of HTML_Template_Xipe, 
however in Version 0.2, It became one of the first template engine to use a real Lexer,
rather than regex'es, making it possible to do things like ASP.net or Cold Fusion tags. 
However, it still has a very simple set of goals.
- Very Simple API, 
   o easy to learn...
   o prevents to much logic going in templates
- Easy to write document'able code
   o By using object vars for a template rather than 'assign', you 
     can use phpdoc comments to list what variable you use.
- Editable in WYSIWYG editors
   o you can create full featured templates, that doesnt get broken every time you edit with 
     Dreamweaver(tm) or Mozzila editor
   o Uses namespaced attributes to add looping/conditionals  
- Extremely Fast, 
   o runtime is at least 4 time smaller than most other template engines (eg. Smarty)
   o uses compiled templates, as a result it is many times faster on blocks and loops than 
     than Regex templates (eg. IT/phplib)
- Safer (for cross site scripting attacks)
   o All variables default to be output as HTML escaped (overridden with the :h modifier)
- Multilanguage support
   o Parses strings out of template, so you can build translation tools
   o Compiles language specific templates (so translation is only done once, not on every request)
- Full dynamic element support (like ASP.NET), so you can pick elements to replace at runtime

Features:
- {variable} to echo $object-&gt;variable
- {method()} to echo $object-&gt;method();
- {foreach:var,key,value} to PHP foreach loops
- tag attributes FLEXY:FOREACH, FLEXY:IF for looping and conditional HTML inclusion
- {if:variable} to PHP If statement
- {if:method()} to PHP If statement
- {else:} and {end:} to close or alternate If statements
- FORM to HTML_Template_Flexy_Element's
- replacement of INPUT, TEXTAREA and SELECT tags with HTML_Template_Flexy_Element code
  use FLEXY:IGNORE (inherited) and FLEXY:IGNOREONLY (single) to prevent replacements
- FLEXY:START/FLEXY:STARTCHILDREN tags to define where template starts/finishes
- support for urlencoded braces {} in HTML attributes.  
- documentation in the pear manual

- examples at http://cvs.php.net/cvs.php/pear/HTML_Template_Flexy/tests/

** The long term plan for Flexy is to be integrated as a backend for the 
Future Template Package (A BC wrapper will be made available - as I need 
to use it too!)

 <n>Minor Feature Release
 
 Changes
  Note: This release may include some changes which may break BC, (in which case they 
  _are_ bugs and will be fixed.).
  
 

                                                                                                                        
 Features
  #------ Forms without names, now are not generated as HTML_Elements, rather than given a default name.
  #------ support for -ve numbers in {arrays[-1]}
  #------ support for variable replacements in commented out blocks of styles
  #2074 - allow literal numbers in methods, eg. {somemethod(3,#astring#,avar)}  
          Features
  #------ Limited support for Xul in Elements
  #2097   Support for mixing flexy vars within dynamic elements. 
          (If this causes problems, please file a bug report.)
  #------ Forms without names render as plain HTML, rather than generating dynamic
          elements.
  #------ createToken code is simplified and supports writing the position of a token
          (generally for usage in the Tree.php file for parsing html only.)
  #------ Fixed tree builder so it is more tolerant of malformed HTML (eg. form tags
          with closures in the wrong part of the html tree)
  #------ Style element now works with flexy tags (rather than ignoring them within 
          comments)
  #------ Support for translation of alt tags of IMG</n>
