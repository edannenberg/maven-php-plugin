 <d>Replacement for the default renderer of HTML_QuickForm that uses only XHTML and
  CSS but no table tags, and generates fully valid XHTML output.</d>

 <n>- this package is now in beta status, i.e. the API can be considered as stable
- this package is now licensed under the New BSD license
- end-user documentation is now available in the manual
- bugfix: for real groups (e.g. groups of checkboxes) the &quot;id&quot; attribute was
  set two times (and an invalid &quot;for&quot; attribute was added to the label
  element)
- changes in the div tag (in the form template) for the hidden elements:
  * added a line break (\n) after the opening div tag
  * added a tab (\t) before the closing div tag
- changes in the templates: rows (consisting of a label and an element) are not
  put anymore into a div tag, but in a li element (and all li elements in an ol
  element); this adds also a more semantical meaning to the generated forms
  (a full list of changes to the templates is available on
  http://pear.markwiesemann.eu/template-changes-0.4.0.txt)

  WARNING: you need to adopt the stylesheet changes (see also below) to
           your stylesheets, because otherwise your forms will not work
           (in terms of layout) anymore

- example file: added three hidden form elements
- added &quot;id&quot; attribute also to group elements (and the &quot;for&quot; attribute to the
  label tag for groups)
- added &quot;id&quot; attribute also to hidden elemens
- removed &quot;qf&quot; prefix from CSS class names
  (exception: &quot;label.qflabel&quot; was renamed into &quot;label.element&quot;)
- adjusted the layout in the example file and the bundled stylesheet to the
  layout of the default renderer:
  * fieldsets now don't have a border and no top or bottom margin, and the
    fieldset legends have gotten a grey background (in Firefox not for the whole
    width of the fieldset)
  * element labels are now in a bold font
  * the required note is now horizontally aligned like the form elements, and
    not as before on the left margin
  (a comparison of all changes to the stylesheet is available on
  http://pear.markwiesemann.eu/stylesheet-comparison-0.4.0.txt)</n>
