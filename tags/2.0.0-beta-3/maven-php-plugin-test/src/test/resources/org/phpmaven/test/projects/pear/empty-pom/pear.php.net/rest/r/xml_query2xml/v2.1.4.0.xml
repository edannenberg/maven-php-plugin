 <s>Creates XML data from SQL queries</s>
 <d>XML_Query2XML allows you to transform the records retrieved
with one or more SQL SELECT queries into XML data. Very simple to
highly complex transformations are supported. Is was written with
performance in mind and can handle large amounts of data. No XSLT needed!
Major features:
1. XML_Query2XML works with the classes provided by PHP5's built-in DOM API
2. minimum effort necessary to get the simple jobs done
3. highly configurable for more complex tasks
4. ISO/IEC 9075-14:2005 support: mapping of SQL identifiers to XML names
5. works with any database that is supported by PDO, PEAR DB, PEAR MDB2 or ADOdb
6. easy integration of other XML data sources (e.g. raw XML data stored in the DB)
7. debugging, logging and profiling features
8. XML encoding: support for UTF-8, ISO-8859-1 and others
9. in-depth documentation and case studies: tutorials and API documentation
10. 1084 phpt unit tests</d>

 <n>This sixth stable release contains a couple of new features:
- PDO support - this also adds support for SQLite 3 (thanks to
  John P. McCaskey for pointing out the lack of SQLite 3 support)
- all unit tests now run with SQLite 2 by default; unit tests
  for PDO and PEAR MDB2 will therefore work out of the box
- XML_Query2XML now comes with 1084 phpt unit tests</n>
