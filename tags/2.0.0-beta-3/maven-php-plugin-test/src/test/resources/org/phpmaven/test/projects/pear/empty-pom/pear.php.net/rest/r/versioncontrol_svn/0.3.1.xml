 <s>Simple OO wrapper interface for the Subversion command-line client.</s>
 <d>What is VersionControl_SVN?

VersionControl_SVN is a simple OO-style interface for Subversion,
the free/open-source version control system.

VersionControl_SVN can be used to manage trees of source code, 
text files, image files -- just about any 
collection of files.

Some of VersionControl_SVN's features:

* Full support of svn command-line client's 
  subcommands.
* Use of flexible error reporting provided by
  PEAR_ErrorStack.
* Multi-object factory.
* Source fully documented with PHPDoc.
* Stable, extensible interface.
* Collection of helpful quickstart examples and
  tutorials.

What can be done with VersionControl_SVN?

* Make your source code available to your 
  remote dev team or project manager.

* Build your own WYSIWYG web interface to a
  Subversion repository.
 
* Add true version control to a content management
  system!
  
Note: Requires a Subversion installation.
Subverison is available from
http://subversion.tigris.org/

VersionControl_SVN is tested against Subversion 1.0.4</d>

 <n>The 0.3.1 alpha release addresses a vast majority of open items discovered 
with the VersionControl_SVN 0.3.0alpha1 release.
     
 * Fix Bug #5020: Code-bug, missing break in switch [clay]
 * Fix Bug #5099: Copy ignores source, traget and switches [clay]
 * Fix Bug #9351: log does not accept the 'limit' switch [clay]
 * Fix Bug #9998: Regular Expression Matching For List [clay]
 * Fix Bug #11935: All checkouts are non-recursive due to a typo in SVN/Checkout.php [clay]
 * Implement Feature #5021: SVN objects are not reusable [clay]
 * Implement Feature #9343: Using non-english file/dir names [clay]
 
A new public property called 'prepend_cmd' is supported to allow environment 
variables controlling things such as character encoding to be prepended to 
the Subversion command execution. This was introduced in response to #9343.

NOTE: This is very likely to be among the last of PHP 4 compatible releases.
Significant refactoring is already underway for a PHP 5-only release of the 
package. If significant issues are found in this release, a few more 0.3.x 
releases may be made.</n>
