 <s>Preferences management class</s>
 <d>Preference Manager is a class to handle user preferences in a web application, looking them up in a table using a combination of their userid, and the preference name to get a value, and (optionally) returning a default value for the preference if no value could be found for that user.

It is designed to be used alongside the PEAR Auth class, but can be used with anything that allows you
to obtain the user's id - including your own code.</d>

 <n>* Moved DB connection out of constructor so connection is only made when
  needed and error handling can be done properly.
* Added option to return PEAR_Error objects when a problem occurs.
* General code cleanup.
* Switched to package.xml 2.0.
* Added test suite.
* Fix Bug #9469. Attempts to use DB connection even if error generated
  while connecting.</n>
