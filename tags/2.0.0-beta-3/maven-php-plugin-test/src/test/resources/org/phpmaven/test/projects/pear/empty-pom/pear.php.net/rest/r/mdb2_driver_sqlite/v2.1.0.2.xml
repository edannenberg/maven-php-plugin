 <s>sqlite MDB2 driver</s>
 <d>This is the SQLite MDB2 driver.
 
</d>
 <da>2006-05-14 02:41:03</da>
 <n>- explicitly set is_manip parameter to false for transaction debug calls
- added ability to hint that a constraint is a primary key in dropConstraint()
- typo fixes in phpdoc (thx Stoyan)
- added support for fixed and variable types for 'text' in declarations,
  as well as in reverse engineering (Request #1523)
- made _doQuery() return a reference
- added userinfo's to all raiseError calls that previously had none
- added 'prepared_statements' supported meta data setting

open todo items:
- a number of the manager test cases fail because sqlite does not support adding
  primary keys to existing tables
- the alter table tests fails because this is unsupported in sqlite2
- the test replace test fails because sqlite reports an incorrect affected rows
  value when no existing data was replaced</n>
